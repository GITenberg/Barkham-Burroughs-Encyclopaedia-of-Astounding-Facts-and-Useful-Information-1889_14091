    <h2>How Poor Boys Become Successful Men.</h2>

    <p>You want some good advice. Rise early. Be abstemious. Be
    frugal. Attend to your own business and never trust it to
    another. Be not afraid to work, and diligently, too, with your
    own hands. Treat every one with civility and respect. Good
    manners insure success. Accomplish what you undertake. Decide,
    then persevere. Diligence and industry overcome all
    difficulties. Never be mean&mdash;rather give than take the odd
    shilling. Never postpone till to-morrow what can be done
    to-day. Never anticipate wealth from any source but labor.
    Honesty is not only the best policy, but the only policy.
    Commence at the first round and keep climbing. Make your word
    as good as your bond. Seek knowledge to plan, enterprise to
    execute, honesty to govern all. Never overtrade. Never give too
    large credit. Time is money. Reckon the hours of the day as so
    many dollars, the minutes as so many cents. Make few promises.
    Keep your secrets. Live within your income. Sobriety above all
    things. Luck is a word that does not apply to a successful man.
    Not too much caution&mdash;slow but sure is the thing. The
    highest monuments are built piece by piece. Step by step we
    mount the pyramids. Be bold&mdash;be resolute when the clouds
    gather, difficulties are surmounted by opposition.
    Self-confidence, self-reliance is your capital. Your conscience
    the best monitor. Never be over-sanguine, but do not underrate
    your own abilities. Don't be discouraged.
    <ins class="correction"
         title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'Ninty-nine'.">
    Ninety-nine</ins> may say no, the <ins class="correction"
         title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'hundreth'.">
    hundredth</ins>, yes: take off your coat: roll up your sleeves,
    don't be afraid of manual labor! America is large enough for
    all&mdash;strike out for the west. The best letter of
    introduction is your own energy. Lean on yourself when you
    walk. Keep good company. Keep out of politics unless you are
    sure to win&mdash;you are never sure to win, so look out.</p>

    <div class="figleft">
        <img src="images/ill010.jpg"
             alt="Fancy T" />
    </div>

    <p>The subject of the importance of good writing is as broad as
    its use. Reaching out in every direction, and pervading every
    corner of civilized society, from the humblest up to the
    highest employments, it is a servant of man, second only in
    importance to that of speech itself. In the world of business
    its value is seen, from the simplest record or memorandum, up
    to the parchment which conveys a kingdom. Without it, the
    wheels of commerce could not move a single hour. At night it
    has recorded the transactions of the Bank of England during the
    day; of London; of the whole world.</p>

    <p>Through the art of writing, the deeds of men live after
    them, and we may surround ourselves with the companionship of
    philosophers, scientists, historians, discoverers and poets;
    and their discoveries, and reasonings and imaginings become
    ours. In the amenities of social life, through the medium of
    the pen, heart speaks to heart, though ocean rolls between.
    Thoughts of tenderness and affection live when we are gone, and
    words and deeds of kindness are not preserved by monuments
    alone. What fountains of grief or joy have been opened in the
    hearts of those who have read the records of the pen! The pen
    has recorded the rapturous emotions of love reciprocated. The
    pen has written the message of sadness which has covered life's
    pilgrimage with gloom. The pen has traced the record of noble
    and useful lives, spent in humanity's cause. The songs of the
    poet, the beautiful tints of his imagination, the flights of
    the orator in the realms of fancy, and the facts of history,
    would all perish as the dew of morning, without this noble art
    of writing.</p>

    <p>As a means of livelihood, there is perhaps no other
    department of education which affords such universal and
    profitable employment, as writing. From the mere copyist, up to
    the practical accountant, and onward into that department of
    penmanship designated as a fine art, the remuneration is always
    very ample, considering the time and effort required in its
    acquisition.</p>

    <p>Teachers, editors, farmers, doctors and all persons should
    possess a practical and substantial knowledge of writing, and
    should be ready with the pen. Business men must of course be
    ready writers, and hence, in a treatise on business, designed
    for the education and advancement of the youth of the country,
    it seems eminently fitting to first make the way clear to a
    plain, practical handwriting. Neatness and accuracy should
    characterize the handwriting of every one. Botch-work and
    bungling are inexcusable, as well in writing as in the
    transaction of business. No person has a right to cause a tinge
    of shame to their correspondent, by sending a letter addressed
    in a stupid and awkward manner, nor to consume the time of
    another in deciphering the illegible hooks and scrawls of a
    message. Every one should have the ambition to <i>write</i>
    respectably as well as to <i>appear</i> respectable on any
    occasion.</p>

    <h4>MATERIALS USED IN WRITING.</h4>

    <p>Having a suitable desk or table, arranged with reference to
    light, in order to learn to write, it is necessary to be
    provided with proper materials. Writing materials
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"
       id="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span> are so abundant and so cheap in
       these times that no excuse is afforded for using an inferior
       or worthless quality. The materials consist of <i>Pens,
       Ink</i> and <i>Paper</i>.</p>

    <h4>PENS.</h4>

    <p>Steel pens are considered the best. Gold pens have the
    advantage of always producing the same quality of writing,
    while steel pens, new or old, produce finer or courser lines.
    Notwithstanding this advantage in favor of the gold pen, steel
    pens adhere to the paper, and produce a better line. The pen
    should be adapted to the hand of the writer. Some persons
    require a coarse pen, and some fine. Elastic pens in the hand
    of one writer may produce the best results, while a less
    flexible pen may suit the hand of others best. Pens are
    manufactured of almost an infinite grade and quality, in order
    to suit the requirements of all. About the only rule that can
    be given in selecting pens, is to write a few lines, or a page,
    with each of the pens on trial, and then compare the writing.
    If it be shaded too heavily, select a less flexible pen, if the
    hair lines are too delicate, select a coarser pen.</p>

    <h4>INK.</h4>

    <p>Black ink is always preferable. That which is free from
    sediment and flows well, should be selected. Use an inkstand
    with broad base as being less liable to upset. With persons in
    learning to write it is perhaps best to have a quality of ink
    which is perfectly black when put on the paper, in order that
    they may see the results of their labor at once. Business men
    and accountants prefer a fluid ink, however, which, although
    not black at first, continues to grow black, and becomes a very
    bright and durable black, notwithstanding the action of light
    and heat. Avoid the use of fancy colored inks, especially the
    more gaudy, such as blue, red or green, in writing all
    documents which you desire to command attention and
    respect.</p>

    <h4>PAPER.</h4>

    <p>There are almost as many grades of paper to be found in the
    stationery stores, as there are of pens. For practicing
    penmanship, nothing is more suitable than foolscap, which may
    be easily sewed into book-form, with cover of some different
    color, and thus serves every requirement. The paper should have
    a medium surface, neither rough and coarse, or too fine and
    glazed. Have a few extra sheets beside the writing book, for
    the purpose of practicing the movement exercises and testing
    the pens. Be provided at all times with a large-sized blotter,
    and when writing, keep this under the hand. Do not attempt to
    write with a single sheet of paper on a bare table or desk;
    there should be many sheets of paper underneath, in order to
    make an elastic surface.</p>

    <h4>STUDY WITH PRACTICE.</h4>

    <p>Aimless, indifferent, or careless practice, never made a
    good writer, and never will. In order to succeed in this, as in
    other things, there must be will and determination to succeed,
    and then persevering and studious effort. Study the models
    until their forms are fixed in the mind.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill011.png"
             alt="Study gives form" />
    </div>

    <p>No one can execute that which he does not clearly conceive.
    The artist must first see the picture on the white canvas,
    before he can paint it, and the sculptor must be able to see in
    the rough and uninviting stone, the outlines of the beautiful
    image which he is to carve. In writing, a clear idea of the
    formation of the different letters, and their various
    proportions, must become familiar by proper study, examination
    and analysis. Study precedes practice. It is, of course, not
    necessary, nor even well, to undertake the mastery of all the
    forms in writing, by study, until some have been executed. It
    is best that each form should, as it is taken up, be first
    measured and analyzed and then practiced at once.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill012.png"
             alt="Practice gives grace" />
    </div>

    <p>It is the act which crowns the thought. After study, careful
    and earnest practice can hardly fail to make a good writer of
    any one. Some persons secure a good style of penmanship with
    less labor than others, and attain to the elegant, and
    beautiful formation. But it is only fair to presume that no
    greater diversity of talent exists in this direction than in
    the study of other things. All do not learn arithmetic or
    history with like ease, but no one will assert that all who
    will, may not learn arithmetic or history. And so, all who will
    put forth the proper exertion in study and practice may learn
    to write a good business style, while many of the number will
    attain to the elegant. The conditions of practice in writing
    are, <i>Positions of the Body, Position of the Hand an Pen, and
    Movement</i>.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"
       id="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill013.png"
             alt="Position of the Body" />
    </div>

    <h3>POSITION of the BODY.</h3>

    <p>Sitting squarely fronting the desk, with feet placed firmly
    on the floor, and both arms on the desk, is, as a rule, the
    best position for practice in writing, or correspondence. The
    right side, may, however, be placed to the desk, with the right
    arm, only, resting thereon, and some persons prefer this
    position. Avoid crossing the feet, sitting on the edge of the
    chair, or assuming any careless attitude. The body should be
    erect, but slightly inclined forward, in order that the eye may
    follow the pen closely. This position will never cause
    curvature of the spine. The body should never be allowed to
    settle down into a cramped and unhealthy position with the face
    almost on the paper. By thus compressing the lungs and the
    digestive organs they are soon injured, and if the stomach lose
    its tone, the eyesight is impaired, there is such a close
    sympathy between these organs of the body. The practice of
    writing should be, and properly is, a healthful exercise, and
    injurious effects result only from improper positions of the
    body, at variance with good writing as well as good health.</p>

    <p>When wearied by sitting and the effort at writing, lay aside
    paper and pen, arise from the chair, and take exercise and rest
    by walking about the room or in the open air. Then come back
    refreshed, and vigorous, for the practice of writing.</p>

    <p>In general, the light should fall on the paper from the left
    side, thus enabling a writer to clearly see the ruled lines,
    and render the labor of writing easier and more rapid. If one
    writes left-handed, of course He will sit so as to get his
    light from the right side, or over the right shoulder.</p>

    <h4>SHADING.</h4>

    <p>As a beautifier of the handwriting, by causing a diversity
    of light and shade among the letters, shading has its value;
    but in the practical handwriting for business purposes, it
    should, as a rule, be classed with flourishing, and left out.
    Requiring time and effort, to bring down the shades on letters,
    business men, clerks and telegraph operators find a uniform and
    regular style of writing, without shade, the best, even though
    it may not be as artistic.</p>

    <h4>UNIFORMITY.</h4>

    <p>A most necessary element in all good penmanship is
    uniformity. In the slope of the letters and words which form a
    written page there must be no disagreement. With the letters
    leaning about in various directions, writing is presented in
    its most ridiculous phase. Uniformity in the size of letters,
    throughout the written page; how greatly it conduces to
    neatness and beauty. All letters resting on the line, and being
    of uniform hight, adds another condition towards good
    penmanship. This essential element of uniformity may be watched
    and guarded closely and cultivated by any learner in his own
    practice.</p>

    <h4>SLANT OF WRITING.</h4>

    <p>As said before, it matters not so much what angle of slant
    is adopted in writing, provided it is made uniform, and all
    letters are required to conform exactly to the same slant.
    Writing which is nearest perpendicular is most legible, and
    hence is preferable for business purposes. The printed page of
    perpendicular type; how legible it is. But for ease in
    execution, writing should slant. It follows then that writing
    should be made as perpendicular as is consistent with ease of
    execution. The slant of writing should not be less than sixty
    degrees from the
    horizontal.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"

    </div>

    <h3>POSITION of the BODY WHILE STANDING</h3>

    <p>The practical book-keeper finds it advantageous to do his
    writing while standing; in fact, where large books are in use,
    and entries are to be transferred from one to another, the work
    of the book-keeper can hardly be performed otherwise than in a
    standing position, free to move about his office. Cumbrous
    books necessitate a different position at the desk, from that
    of the correspondent, or the learner. Since large books must
    lie squarely on the desk, the writer, in order to have the
    proper position thereto, must place his left side to the desk.
    The body thus has the same relative position, as if squarely
    fronting the desk with the paper or book placed diagonally. In
    other words, the writer, while engaged in writing in large,
    heavy books, must adjust himself to the position of the books.
    Should the correspondent or bill clerk perform his work while
    standing, he would assume the same as the sitting
    position&mdash;squarely fronting the desk.</p>

    <div class="figleft">
        <img src="images/ill016.jpg"
             alt="Man Standing at Writing Desk" />
    </div>

    <h4>LEGIBILITY.</h4>

    <p>Children, in learning to write, are apt to sacrifice all
    other good qualities of beauty, regularity and grace, for the
    quality of legibility, or plainness. With some older persons
    this legibility is considered of very little consequence, and
    is obscured by all manner of meaningless flourishes, in which
    the writer takes pride. In the estimation of the business man,
    writing is injured by shades and flourishes. The demand of this
    practical time is a plain, regular style that can be written
    rapidly, and read at a glance.</p>

    <h4>FINISH.</h4>

    <p>By a careless habit, which many persons allow themselves to
    fall into, they omit to attend to the little things in writing.
    Good penmanship consists in attention to small details, each
    letter and word correctly formed, makes the beautiful page. By
    inattention to the finish of one letter, or part of a letter of
    a word, oftentimes the word is mistaken for another, and the
    entire meaning changed. Particular attention should be devoted
    to the finish of some of the small letters, such as the dotting
    of the i, or crossing of the t. Blending the lines which form a
    loop, often causes the letter to become a stem, similar to the
    t or d, or an e to become an i. In many of the capital letters,
    the want of attention to the finish of the letter converts it
    into another or destroys its identity, such, for instance, as
    the small cross on the capital F, which, if left off, makes the
    letter a T. The W often becomes an M, or <i>vice versa</i>, and
    the I a J. Mistakes in this regard are more the result of
    carelessness and inattention than anything else. By careful
    practice a person will acquire a settled habit of giving a
    perfection to each letter and word, and then it is no longer a
    task, but is performed naturally and almost involuntarily,
    while the difference in the appearance of the written page, as
    well as the exactness and certainty of the meaning conveyed,
    may be incalculably great.</p>

    <p>While practicing penmanship, or while endeavoring to correct
    a careless habit in writing, the mind must be upon the work in
    hand, and not be allowed to wander into fields of thought or
    imagination; by thus confining the attention, any defect or
    imperfection in the formation of letters may be soon mastered
    or corrected.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill017.png"
             alt="Position of the Hand and Pen." />
    </div>

    <h2>POSITION OF THE HAND AND PEN</h2>

    <p>The right arm should rest on the muscles just below the
    elbow, and wrist should be elevated so as to move free from
    paper and desk. Turn the hand so that the wrist will be level,
    or so that the back of the hand will face the ceiling. The
    third and fourth fingers turned slightly underneath the hand
    will form its support, and the pen, these fingers and the
    muscles of the arm near the elbow form the only points of rest
    or contact on desk or paper. The pen should point over the
    shoulder, and should be so held that it may pass the root of
    the nail on the second finger, and about opposite the knuckle
    of the hand. An unnatural or cramped position of the hand, like
    such a position of the body, is opposed to good writing, and
    after many years of observation and study, all teachers concur
    in the one position above described, as being the most natural,
    easy and graceful for the writer, and as affording the most
    freedom and strength of movement.</p>

    <p>Avoid getting the hand in an awkward or tiresome position,
    rolling it over to one side, or drawing the fore finger up into
    a crooked shape. Hold the pen firmly but lightly, not with a
    grip as if it were about to escape from service. Do not say, "I
    can't" hold the pen correctly. Habits are strong, but will may
    be stronger, and if you hold the pen correctly in spite of old
    habits, for a few lessons, all will then be easy, and the pen
    will take its position at each writing exercise, with no effort
    whatever. Everything being in readiness, and the proper
    position assumed, the writer must now obtain complete control
    of hand and pen, by practice in movement.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill018.jpg"
             alt="Hand With Pen and Ink Bottle" />
    </div>

    <h4>RAPIDITY.</h4>

    <p>One of the essentials of a practical business style of
    writing must be rapidity of execution, in order to be of any
    avail in the necessities and press of a business position. The
    demand of the merchant is, that his clerk shall not only write
    well, but with rapidity, and the volume of letters to be
    answered, bills to be made out, or items to be entered on the
    books of account, compel the clerk to move the pen with
    dexterity and rapidity, as well as skill. While there is great
    diversity among persons as to the rapidity as well as quality
    of their penmanship, some being naturally more alert and active
    than others, yet by securing the proper position of the hand,
    arm and body, favorable to ease and freedom of execution, then
    following this with careful practice in movement, until all the
    varied motions necessary in writing are thoroughly mastered,
    the person may, with suitable effort, acquire the quality of
    rapidity in writing, gradually increasing the speed until the
    desired rate is accomplished.</p>

    <h4>BEAUTY.</h4>

    <p>In the handwriting, as in other things, beauty is largely a
    matter of taste and education. To the man of business, the most
    beautiful handwriting is that which is written with ease, and
    expresses plainly and neatly the thought of the writer. To the
    professional or artistic taste, while such a hand may be
    regarded as "a good business hand," it would not be considered
    as beautiful, because it conforms to no rule as to proportion,
    shade, and spacing. In the practical art of writing, it is not
    very unfair to measure its beauty largely by its
    utility.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"
       id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span>

    <div class="figcenter">

    <h3>MOVEMENT.</h3>

    <div class="figleft">
        <img src="images/ill020.jpg"
             alt="Fancy F" />
    </div>

    <p>Finger movement, or writing by the use of the fingers as the
    motive power, is entirely inadequate to the requirements of
    business. The fingers soon become tired, the hand becomes
    cramped, the writing shows a labored effort, and lacks freedom
    and ease so essential to good business penmanship. In the
    office or counting-room, where the clerk or correspondent must
    write from morning till night, the finger movement of course
    cannot be used.</p>

    <p>What is designated by writing teachers as the Whole Arm, or
    Free Arm Movement, in which the arm is lifted free from the
    desk and completes the letter with a dash or a swoop, is
    necessary in ornamental penmanship and flourishing, but has no
    place in a practical style of business writing. The man of
    business would hardly stop, in the midst of his writing, to
    raise the arm, and execute an "off-hand capital," while
    customers are waiting.</p>

    <p>But adapted to the practical purposes of business is the
    <i>muscular movement</i>, in which the arm moves freely on the
    muscles below the elbow, and in cases of precise writing, or in
    the more extended letters, such as f, is assisted by a slight
    movement of the fingers. The third and fourth fingers may
    remain stationary on the paper, and be moved from time to time,
    or between words, where careful and accurate writing is
    desired, but in more rapid, free and flowing penmanship, the
    fingers should slide over the paper.</p>

    <h4>MOVEMENT EXERCISES.</h4>

    <p>Having everything in readiness, the student may begin his
    practice on movement exercises, the object of which is to
    obtain control of the pen and train the muscles. Circular
    motion, as in the capital O, reversed as in the capital W,
    vertical movement as in f, long s and capital J, and the
    lateral motion as in small letters, must each be practiced in
    order to be able to move the pen in any direction, up, down, or
    sidewise.</p>

    <p>The simplest exercise in movement. Try to follow around in
    the same line as nearly as possible. Do not shade.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill021.jpg"
             alt="0 0 8" />
    </div>

    <p>The same exercise, only with ovals drawn out and and slight
    shade added to each down stroke.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill022.jpg"
             alt="Ovals" />
    </div>

    <p>Sides of ovals should be even, forming as nearly a straight
    line as possible. Reverse the movement as in third form.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill023.jpg"
             alt="Ovals" />
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"
       id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span>

    <p>The following three exercises embrace the essential elements
    in capital letters, and should at first be made large for
    purposes of movement:</p>

    <p>Capital O, down strokes parallel.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill024.jpg"
             alt="O Q O Q O O Q O Q O" />
    </div>

    <p>Capital stem. Down stroke a compound curve. Shade low.
    Finish with a dash.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill025.jpg"
             alt="d d d d d d d d d" />
    </div>

    <p>Capital loop. Curves parallel. First curve highest.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill026.jpg"
             alt=" O O O O (double overlapping loops)" />
    </div>

    <p>Having succeeded to some extent with these exercises, the
    learner may next undertake the vertical movement. In order to
    obtain the lateral movement, which enables one to write long
    words without lifting the pen, and move easily and gracefully
    across the page, exercises like the following should be
    practiced:</p>

    <p>Down strokes straight. Even and resting on line.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill027.jpg"
             alt="uuuuuuuuuuu" />
    </div>

    <p>In all movement exercises the third and fourth fingers
    should slide on the paper, and the finger movement should be
    carefully avoided. The different movements having been
    practiced, they may now be combined in various forms</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill028.jpg"
             alt="u u u u u n n n n n" />
    </div>

    <p>Lateral and rolling movement combined. Vertical movement and
    rolling movement combined.</p>

    <p>Do not shade the circles. Lines should be parallel.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill029.jpg"
             alt="t t t" />
    </div>

    <p>Movement exercises may be multiplied almost indefinitely by
    studying the forms used in writing and their combinations.
    Repeating many of the small letters, such as m, u, e, r, s, a,
    d, h and c, also capitals D, J, P, etc., forms an excellent
    exercise for the learner.</p>

    <h3>PRINCIPLES IN WRITING.</h3>

    <p>In order to enable the learner to examine, analyze and
    criticise his writing, the following principles are given as
    his standards of measurements and form. By combining them in
    various ways the essential part of all letters in the alphabet
    may be formed.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill030.jpg"
             alt="(eight common strokes)" />
    </div>

    <p>The principles must be first carefully studied, and
    separated into the primary lines which compose them and the
    form of each principle well understood. The student may then
    form a scale like the one following, by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"
       id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span> dividing the distance between
       the blue lines on the paper into four equal spaces, with a
       lightly ruled line. The letters of the small alphabet should
       then be placed in the scale and the <ins class="correction"
         title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'hight'">height</ins>
         of each letter fixed in the mind.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill031.jpg"
             alt="(lowercase cursive alphabet)" />
    </div>

    <p>Notice that the contracted letters, or those which occupy
    only one space, as a, m, n, o, s, v, w and e, and that part of
    d, g, h, q and y, found in the first space, are all well
    rounded and developed. These letters and parts of letters,
    found in the first space, form the essential part of all
    writing, and therefore deserve especial care. Also notice that
    the loop letters, above the line, such as b, f, h, k and l,
    extend two and one-half spaces above the blue line, while the
    loop below the line, such as g, f, j, q, y and z, extend one
    and one-half spaces below the blue line, thus two and one-half
    and one and one-half making the four spaces of the scale, and
    the upper loops on one line will just meet the lower loops of
    the line above, but never conflict, to the destruction of neat
    body writing. Notice the type of the printer. The extensions
    above the shorter letters are quite insignificant, and are only
    used to save the letter from resembling some other letter of
    the alphabet. They never conflict, and how legible they
    are.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Besides, to make long loops, requires more time, and more
    power with the pen, while shorter loops are in every way easier
    to acquire, quicker, and better. Telegraph operators, some of
    whom are among our best business penmen, make all extended
    letters very short, while accountants, and business men, favor
    the style of short loops, well developed letters, and small
    capitals.</p>

             alt="(samples of writing)" />
    </div>

    <p>In order to practice capital letters to advantage, as well
    as to study them, collect in a group or family all those
    letters which have some one form or principle as an essential
    part. Take first the 6th principle, or oval, and we group the
    letters as follows:</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill035.jpg"
             alt="O. D. C. E. P. Q. R." />
    </div>

    <p>The excellence of an oval depends largely on its fullness
    and roundness. No corners or flat
    sides.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"
       id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill036.jpg"
             alt="(samples of writing)" />
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"
       id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span>

    <p>In the capital loop, or 8th principle, another oval may be
    made within the large turn at the top, but for practical
    purposes the letter is perhaps better without it, and may be
    simplified even more, as in the N below.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill037.jpg"
             alt="(samples of writing)" />
    </div>

    <h4>FIGURES.</h4>

    <p>Make figures small, neat, and of form exact. Each figure
    must show for itself, and cannot be known by those which
    precede or follow it, as is the case with letters. The common
    tendency is to make figures too large and coarse. Mind the
    ovals in figures and have them full and round. The chief
    excellence of the zero lies in its roundness; the 3, 5, 6 or 9,
    without care in making the ovals, may degenerate into a
    straight line, or simply a meaningless hook, which it would
    hardly be safe to use in expressing sums of money, ordering
    goods, or the transaction of other business.</p>

    hand, the pen becomes an instrument of beauty. As by the power
    of speech, men may pass from the common tone of conversation up
    to the melodious strains of music, or may soar in flights of
    oratory into the sublime, until the multitude is entranced; so
    the capabilities of the pen are not limited to the common uses
    of life, but may take on forms of beauty in elegant outlines of
    bird, or landscape, or graceful swan or bounding stag.</p>

    <p>Ornamental writing is not a practical art, and has no
    connection whatever with the practical business of life. It is
    in the realm of poetry. The imagery of graceful outlines must
    first be seen by a poetic imagination. While the great masses
    may acquire a good style of plain, practical penmanship, few
    have the necessary conception of mind, combined with the skill
    and dexterity of hand to become successful ornamental
    penmen.</p>

    <p>The ornamental pages which follow are given, not as models
    for imitation or practice by the learner, but merely to show
    the possibilities of the pen in the hand of a master, and as a
    fitting closing to this, our chapter on penmanship.</p>

    <p>To any one who may have an artistic quality of mind, and
    delights in beautiful lines and harmonious curves, these pages
    of ornamental penmanship will serve as models for practice and
    imitation, and every attempt at such an exercise as the one on
    this, or the following pages, will give greater strength and
    freedom of movement, and better command of the pen, so that it
    will conduce to an easy, flowing and elegant style of plain
    business writing, while affording a most pleasant and
    profitable employment in the cultivation of the taste.</p>

    <p>Various beautiful designs or pictures may be made with the
    pen, in the hands of one that possesses the skill of a penman
    and the eye of an artist.</p>

    <h2>HOW TO WRITE A BUSINESS LETTER</h2>

    <p>Considering the vast amount of business transacted by
    correspondence between the parties, Letter Writing seems only
    second in importance to bookkeeping. The merchant of the
    smaller cities or towns, perhaps in the far west, desires to
    order articles of merchandise from the wholesale house in New
    York or Boston. Possibly a remittance is to be sent. It may be
    that an error has occurred and needs correction. Credit is to
    be asked, references given, and a multitude of other matters
    call for adjustment through correspondence. To write every
    conceivable variety and shade of meaning, expressing the proper
    thought in the most fitting and appropriate language, is indeed
    a rare and valuable accomplishment. And when the proper
    language takes on the graceful and businesslike air of the well
    written letter, with its several parts harmoniously arranged,
    it is a combination of brain and skill which can hardly be
    overestimated.</p>

    <p>This subject, therefore, naturally divides itself into two
    parts: <i>The Mechanical Structure</i>, and the <i>Literature
    of a Letter</i>. The former of these being the less difficult
    will be first considered.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill045.jpg"
             alt="Writing Supplies" />
    </div>

    <h3>THE STRUCTURE OF A BUSINESS LETTER.</h3>

    <div class="figright">
        <img src="images/ill047.jpg"
             alt="DIAGRAM OF THE STRUCTURE OF A LETTER" />
    </div>

    <p>Consists in the arrangement of its several parts, with a
    view to the most harmonious effect. Excellent penmanship is
    very desirable, but not absolutely essential. The penmanship
    may indeed be poor, but the arrangement of the several parts of
    the letter, the neatness, and finish, may be such as to give it
    an attractive appearance, while on the other hand, the letter
    may be clothed in the most elegant penmanship, and yet the
    construction be such as to stamp its author as a careless and
    indifferent person, devoid of precision and order.</p>

    <p>No one great thing, but many little things carefully
    watched, and attentively practiced, make up the structure and
    dress of a business letter, and give it a businesslike air. The
    penmanship should be a neat, strong hand, very plain and
    legible, and devoid of all flourish.</p>

    <h3>PAPER AND ENVELOPE.</h3>

    <p>The paper and envelopes used in business correspondence
    should be of a good, durable quality, and a white color is
    preferable. Cheap materials are not only unsatisfactory to the
    writer, but may give the reader an unfavorable impression,
    which would be an injury far exceeding the cost of the best
    stationery for a life time. Persons form impressions from very
    little things sometimes.</p>

    <p>The size of a letter sheet in business correspondence should
    be about 8x10 inches. This sheet affords a sufficient space for
    a communication of ordinary length to be written on one side
    only, which is essential in case the letter is copied in a
    letter press. A sheet of paper, note size, (5x8) is oftentimes
    used for brief communications of no special importance, and not
    designed to be filed for future reference. Among professional
    men the commercial note sheet is more extensively used, but
    with business men the letter size is considered
    preferable.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"
       id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span>

    <p>The envelope should correspond in size to that of the letter
    sheet, and should be a trifle longer than one-half the length
    of the sheet. Thus in a sheet eight by ten inches, one-half the
    length of the sheet is five inches, and this requires the
    length of the envelope to be about five and a quarter inches.
    Its width is usually about three inches. Avoid the use of fancy
    colored and fancy shaped paper and envelopes. These may not be
    objectionable in social correspondence among ladies, but the
    gravity of business affairs does not admit of such display.</p>

    <h3>THE HEADING.</h3>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill048.jpg"
             alt="Letterhead" /><br />
         Chas. A Roberts&nbsp;;&nbsp;;&nbsp;;Wm. J. Dennis<br />

         ROBERT &amp; DENNIS<br />
         DEALERS IN FANCY AND STAPLE GROCERIES,<br />
         320 Jefferson Street,<br />
         Burlington, Va.,______________ 18____
    </div>

    <p>With most firms engaged in business it has become a custom
    to have the business advertisement placed at the head of the
    letter page, together with street, number and city. Thus
    leaving only the date to be inserted to complete the
    heading.</p>

    <p>In case the heading of the letter is to be entirely written,
    it should be placed so as to occupy the right hand half of the
    first two lines at the top of the page. If, however, the letter
    is to be a very brief one, occupying only three or four lines,
    the heading may then be placed lower down on the sheet, so as
    to bring the body of the letter about the center of the
    sheet.</p>

    <p>Writing from a large city the heading should contain the
    street and number. Your correspondent, in directing his answer
    will rely on the address given in the heading of your letter.
    Never be guilty of the blunder committed by ignorant persons of
    placing a part of the heading under the signature.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">

             alt="765 Market Street." /><br />
        765 Market Street,<br />
         Philadelphia, June 10, 1882.
    </div>

    <p>The second line of the heading should begin a little farther
    to the right than the first line, as seen above.</p>

    <p>If the writer has a box at the Post Office and wishes his
    mail delivered there, he may head his letter, as on the
    following page:</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"
       id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span>

    <div class="figcenter">

        P.O. Box 3657,<br />
        New York, May 16, 1882.
    </div>

    <p>Writing from the principal cities of the United States it is
    not necessary to make the name of the state a part of the
    heading, as that is supposed to be known and understood, but
    with smaller cities the name of the state also, should be
    given. Thus, there is a Quincy in Illinois, and also in
    Massachusetts, and unless the state were mentioned a person
    answering a letter from Quincy, would not know which state to
    direct his reply to. In writing from an obscure town or
    village, not only the state should be given, but the county as
    well.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">

        Ottawa, La Salle County, Ill.,<br />
        December 20, 1882.
    </div>

    <p>The punctuation of the heading and other parts of the
    letter, is of great importance in the estimation of cultivated
    persons, and something which can be learned by a little
    attention on the part of anyone, in examining the forms here
    given.</p>

    <h3>MARGIN.</h3>

    <p>A margin three-quarters of an inch in width should be left,
    on the side of the letter, as shown in the diagram. This is
    convenient for any mark or memorandum which your correspondent
    may desire to make concerning anything contained in the letter,
    but its greater value lies in the open, airy, and cheerful
    dress which it imparts to the letter. A margin too narrow
    conveys the idea of stinginess, as if to economize paper, while
    an irregular or zigzag margin conveys the idea of carelessness
    or want of precision. On a sheet of note paper the margin may
    be only one-half inch in width, thus making its width
    proportionate to the size of the sheet.</p>

    <h3>ADDRESS.</h3>

    <p>On the next line below the heading, that is the third line
    from the top of the sheet, and beginning at the left margin,
    should be placed the <i>Address</i>, which consists of the name
    of the person to whom the letter is written, together with his
    titles, if any, and his place of residence or business. The
    letter is not complete without all this, in the estimation of
    the business man. It does not fully explain itself, if the
    place of residence is not down as well as the name, and in
    preserving a letter press copy, this is quite essential for
    future reference.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill050.jpg"
             alt="Messrs. Samuel Bliss Co., Reading, Pa., Gentlemen:" /><br />

         Messrs. Samuel Bliss Co.<br />
        Reading, Pa.<br />
         Gentlemen:
    </div>

    <p>Or if the letter is written to a person living or doing
    business in a large city, thus:</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill051.jpg"
             alt="Mr. James M. Cummings, 645 Broadway, New York, Sir:" />
        <br />
         Mr. James M. Cummings<br />
         645 Broadway, New York.<br />
         Sir:
    </div>

    <p>The names and residence should not be allowed to extend
    further to the right than about the center of the sheet, thus
    leaving an open space between this and the heading of your
    letter. In case the names or place of residence should be so
    long as to require it, they may be placed thus:</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill052.jpg"
             alt="Messrs. Richards, Shaw, Fitch" /><br />
         Messrs. Richards, Shaw, Fitch<br />
         &amp; Winslow, Chicago.<br />
        Gentlemen:
    </div>

    <p>The words <i>Dear Sir</i> or <i>Gentlemen</i> are sometimes
    placed farther to the left, as in the above example, but most
    business men in their correspondence place this complimentary
    address with reference to the words above them, about
    three-quarters of an inch farther to the right, as shown
    below.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill053.jpg"
             alt="William D. Nelson, Esq." /><br />
         William D. Nelsen, Esq.,<br />
         177 Erie St., Boston,<br />
         Dear Sir:
    </div>

    <p>The custom of placing the address beneath the body instead
    of at the beginning of the letter, is not much in vogue in
    business circles in this country, most business men preferring
    to place the name and address at the head of the sheet, and
    then write at it as if they were talking to the person himself.
    When, however, the address is placed below the letter it should
    occupy the same position as to the margin, etc., as if placed
    at the beginning. The custom is borrowed from the English, and
    its use is confined mostly to government officials and
    professional men.</p>

    <h3>BODY OF THE LETTER.</h3>

    <p>This constitutes the written message. It should begin on the
    same line with the words <i>Dear Sir</i>, or
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"
       id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span> leaving after these words a
       small space. In case the place of residence or business is
       not written in the address, then the complimentary address
       of <i>Dear Sir</i> or <i>Gentlemen</i> will be placed on the
       next line under the name, or fourth line from the top of the
       sheet, and the letter will begin on the fifth line from the
       top, thus:</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill054.jpg"
             alt="Mr. Henry L. Dunham." /><br />
         Mr. Henry L. Dunham,<br />
         Dear Sir:<br />
         In answer to your esteemed favor
    </div>

    <p>Sometimes for the sake of convenience, and the saving of
    time and labor, the letter head has printed in the left corner,
    above the address, a blank form of memorandum as follows:</p>

    <table summary="letter head memo"
           align="center"
           cellpadding="8">
        <tr>
            <td align="right">Referring to}<br />
            yours of.....}</td>

            <th>OR,</th>

            <td align="right">In reply to}<br />
             your favor of.....,}</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>and after this introduction the writer is able speedily to
    get at the marrow of his letter, without acknowledging the
    receipt of a former communication.</p>

    <p>The body of the letter should be divided into as many
    paragraphs as there are distinct subjects in the letter, or a
    new paragraph should be commenced at every change of the
    subject. The habit which some persons have of tacking one
    subject to the end of another, and thus making a letter one
    continuous paragraph of mixed up information, instructions and
    requests, is extremely objectionable. It destroys the force of
    what is said, instead of fixing each thought clearly on the
    mind of the reader; it leaves him confused, and he reads a
    second time and tries to get his ideas fixed and systematized,
    or he throws aside the letter until he has more time in which
    to study it and get the meaning clear.</p>

    <p>If the letter is long and is really concerning only one
    subject, then it may properly be divided into paragraphs by
    separating the different divisions of the subject, and giving a
    paragraph to each. These should be arranged in their logical
    order. Wherever the letter is to contain numerous paragraphs to
    avoid omitting any of the items, it is best to jot them down on
    a slip of paper, then embody them in the letter in their
    natural order.</p>

    <p>The first word of each paragraph should be indented, or
    moved in from the margin, usually about the width of the
    margin. Thus if the margin is three-fourths of an inch in
    width, the paragraph should begin three-fourths of an inch from
    the margin. Some writers, however, prefer to commence the first
    word of the paragraph an inch from the margin, and it is really
    not so essential what the distance is, as that it should be
    uniform, and all the paragraphs begin alike. A little attention
    is necessary here. In ordering goods make each article a
    separate paragraph.</p>

    <h3>COMPLIMENTARY CLOSING AND SIGNATURE.</h3>

    <p>The complimentary closing consists of such words as <i>Yours
    truly</i>, <i>Respectfully</i>, etc., and should be placed on
    the next line beneath the last one occupied by the body of the
    letter, commencing a little to the right of the middle. The
    signature should be placed underneath the words of respect, and
    begin still a little farther to the right. Thus the conclusion
    of the letter will correspond in position and arrangement with
    the heading.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill055.jpg"
             alt="Yours truly, John Maynard." /><br />
         Yours truly,<br />
         John Maynard.
    </div>

    <p>The language of the complimentary closing should be governed
    by the relation between the parties, and should correspond with
    the complimentary address. The first letter between strangers
    should commence with <i>Sir</i> and end with the word
    <i>Respectfully</i>. After the exchange of a few letters and a
    sort of business acquaintance may be said to exist between the
    correspondents,then <i>Dear Sir</i>, and <i>Yours truly</i>,
    may properly be introduced. A little more cordial would be such
    a conclusion as the following:</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill057.jpg"
             alt="Yours very truly, Rinold, Constable &amp; Co.." /><br />

         Yours very truly,<br />
         Rinold, Constable &amp; Co.
    </div>

    <p>The man of business is apt, however, to have one stereotyped
    beginning and ending to all his letters, and seldom stops to
    discriminate between strangers and old customers in this
    respect. Often the conclusion may be connected to the closing
    paragraph with perfect grace and ease thus:</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill056.jpg"
             alt="Respectfully, Henry P. Bowen" /><br />
         Hoping to receive the goods without delay,<br />
        I remain,<br />
         Respectfully,<br />
        Henry P. Bowen.
    </div>

    <p>In the signature of a letter, especial care should be
    exercised. Bear in mind that names of persons are not governed
    by the rules of spelling, and words which precede or follow,
    proper names will not aid us in deciphering them if they are
    poorly written.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"

    <p>The young person who would learn to write a good business
    letter, should, with pen, ink and suitable paper, sit down and
    practice faithfully after the above model. Write and re-write
    it a dozen times or more, until your letter resembles it
    closely. Then take any of the models for letters given near the
    close of this chapter, and with this matter, write a letter
    which will conform with the foregoing model in appearance and
    dress. Write the same matter over again, and improve it in its
    defects. Criticise each line and word. See that no words or
    letters are omitted, and that the punctuation is according to
    the models in this book. Eliminate all ungainly letters,
    shorten the loops, see that each letter rests on the line, and
    that, withal your page is clean and regular.</p>

    <p>The person who will thus devote a little earnest study and
    practice, may early acquire the valuable accomplishment of
    writing a pleasing business letter, so far as the mechanical
    structure goes.</p>

    <h3>ADDRESSING THE ENVELOPE.</h3>

    <p>After the letter is finished, and while it yet lies open
    before you, the Envelope should be addressed. As before stated,
    the directions on the envelope must conform to the address at
    the beginning of the letter, hence the necessity for addressing
    the envelope before the letter is folded.</p>

    <p>The first line of the address of the envelope should consist
    of the name of the person or firm to whom the letter is
    written, together with any appropriate titles, and should be
    written across or a little below the middle of the envelope,
    but never above it, beginning
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"
       id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span> the left edge. The space
       between this first line and the bottom of the envelope
       should be about equally divided among the other lines, each
       of which begins still farther to the right than the one
       above, thus:</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill059.jpg"
             alt="Arnold Constable Envelope" /><br />
         Messrs. Arnold, Constable &amp; Co.,<br />
         Cor. Broadway &amp; 19th Sts.,<br />
         New York City.
    </div>

    <p>When writing to a person in a large city the number and
    street should be a part of the address, and may be placed as in
    the above form, or in the left hand lower corner as
    follows:</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill060.jpg"
             alt="Lewis H. Taylor, Esq., Envelope" /><br />
         Lewis H. Taylor, Esq.,<br />
         Chicago,<br />
         118 Wabash Ave. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ill.
    </div>

    <p>In case the letter is addressed in care of any one this
    should be placed in the lower left corner. If a letter of
    introduction, the words <i>Introducing Mr. John Smith,</i> or
    similar words, should be placed in this corner.</p>

    <p>Letters addressed to small towns or villages should bear the

    <p>Or the name of the county may be placed in the lower left
    corner. The Post Office box number is usually placed in the
    lower left corner.</p>

    <h3>FOLDING A LETTER.</h3>

    <p>Having written an excellent letter, and faultlessly
    addressed the envelope, all may be easily stamped as
    unbusiness-like, and spoiled, by improperly performing so
    simple a part as the folding. Remember that excellent rule
    that, whatever is worth doing should be well done.</p>

    <p>With the letter sheet lying before you, turn the bottom edge
    up so that it lies along with the top edge, thus making a fold
    in the middle, which press down with the thumb nail or with a
    paper folder. Then fold the right edge over so that it falls
    two-thirds the distance across the sheet, and press down the
    edge. Next fold the left edge of the sheet over to the right,
    breaking the fold at the edge of the part folded over just
    before.</p>

    <p>In case a check, note, draft, bill or currency is to be sent
    by letter, it should be placed on the upper half of the sheet
    as it lies open, and then the letter should be folded the same
    as if it were not there. This will fold the paper or document
    in the letter so that it will be difficult to extract it while
    being transmitted in the mails, and so that it will not be
    dropped or lost in opening the letter.</p>

    <p>The letter is now folded so that it will be of equal
    thickness in every part of the envelope. Insert the last broken
    or folded edge in the envelope first, with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"
       id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span> original edges of the sheet
       at the end of the envelope which the stamp is on; when taken
       from the envelope the letter will then be proper side
       up.</p>

    <h3>THE LITERATURE OF A LETTER.</h3>

    <p>To be able to compose a letter requires more ability than to
    give it the proper arrangement and mechanical dress. A mind
    well stored with useful knowledge as well as command of
    language, is necessary in writing a letter on general subjects.
    The strictly business letter requires a thorough understanding
    of the facts concerning which the letter is written, and these
    facts to be set forth in plain and unmistakable language. All
    display of rhetoric or flourish of words is entirely out of
    place in the sober, practical letter of business. The proper
    use of capital letters, punctuation, and correct spelling are
    essential to the well written letter, and with a little care
    and striving may be easily acquired.</p>

    <h3>ARRANGEMENT OF ITEMS.</h3>

    <p>As stated before, each item or subject in a letter should be
    embraced in a separate paragraph. These should be arranged in
    the order in which they would naturally come, either in point
    of time, importance, or as regards policy. Never begin a letter
    abruptly with a complaint, but rather bring in all unpleasant
    subjects toward the close. If an answer to a letter of inquiry,
    take up the questions as they are asked, indicate first what
    the question is, and then state clearly the answer. The first
    paragraph should acknowledge the receipt of the communication
    now to be answered, giving date and indicating its nature and
    contents, thus:</p>

    <p><i>Your letter of the 10th instant concerning damaged goods
    is received, etc.</i></p>

    <p>The closing paragraph usually begins with such words as
    <i>Hoping, Trusting, Awaiting, Thanking</i>, or similar
    expressions, and is complimentary in its tone and designed as a
    courtesy.</p>

    <h3>BREVITY.</h3>

    <p>Business letters should be brief and to the point. The best
    letter states clearly all the facts in the fewest words.
    Brevity is not inconsistent with a long letter, as so much may
    need to be said as to require a long letter, but all
    repetitions, lengthy statements and multiplication of words
    should be avoided. Use short sentences, and make every word
    mean something. Short sentences are more forcible, and more
    easily understood or remembered, than long drawn out
    utterances.</p>

    <h3>STYLE.</h3>

    <p>Style refers to the tone, air, or manner of expression.
    Dignity and strength should characterize the style of the
    business letter. No ornament of expression or eloquence of
    language is necessary or appropriate in a correspondence
    between business men. Come to your meaning at once. State the
    facts. Let every sentence bristle with points.</p>

    <p>The successful business man must possess energy, decision,
    and force, and these qualities should be conspicuous in his
    correspondence in order to command respect. Never use loose or
    slang expressions. The business man should be a
    <i>gentleman</i>. Indulge in no display of superior knowledge
    or education, but temper each paragraph with respect and
    deference to others. The learner who would aspire to write a
    good letter, should, after having finished his attempt, go over
    each sentence carefully and wherever the pronoun I occurs,
    modify the expression so as to leave this out.</p>

    <h3>ORDERING GOODS.</h3>

    <p>In ordering goods of any kind, care should be used to state
    very explicitly the color, size, quality, and quantity of the
    articles desired. If manufactured goods, the name of the
    manufacturer, or his trade mark or brand should be given. Also
    state when you desire the goods shipped and in what way. If by
    freight or express, state what Freight line or Express
    Company.</p>

    <h3>SENDING MONEY BY LETTER.</h3>

    <p>Paper currency should seldom be trusted to pass through the
    mails, as the liability to loss is too great. Better send draft
    or P. O. money order, and in every case the amount of the
    remittance should be stated in the letter, and also whether by
    draft or otherwise sent. The letter may become important
    evidence in regard to payment at some future time.</p>

    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS.</h3>

    <p>In giving instructions to agents, manufacturers and others,
    let each order occupy a separate paragraph. State in
    unmistakable language the instructions desired to be conveyed.
    If possible a diagram or plan should be enclosed in the letter.
    Cautions and complaints, if any, should be clearly set forth in
    paragraphs near the close of the letter.</p>

    <h3>A DUNNING LETTER.</h3>

    <p>State when the debt was contracted, its amount, the fact of
    it having been long past due, the necessity for immediate
    payment, and any other facts depending on
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"
       id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span> the peculiarities of the
       case, which it may seem best to make use of, such as
       promises to pay, which have not been met; the inconvenience
       as well as injury and distrust caused by such
       irregularities, etc.</p>

    <h3>LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION.</h3>

    <p>Be just and truthful, avoiding any stereotyped form in
    letters of introduction. Never give a letter of introduction
    unless you have entire confidence in the person to whom it is
    given; it may reflect on your character or be used against you.
    Be very guarded that no expressions may be construed into a
    letter of credit, thus making the writer liable for payment.
    Use no unfounded statements or assertions, over-estimating your
    friend, as these may prove untrue.</p>

    <p>Willing to extend a favor to a friend by giving a letter of
    introduction, do not be guilty of introducing him to any one in
    whom he may not place confidence, as he might be a loser by
    such.</p>

    <h2>ELEMENTS OF SUCCESS IN BUSINESS</h2>

    <p>In order to succeed in business life, it is necessary to
    cultivate and develop certain qualities and traits of
    character. These are a portion of the capital of the successful
    man, and a more essential portion than money or goods.</p>

        COUNSEL AND ADVICE
    </div>

    <h3>HONESTY.</h3>

    <p>"Sharp practice" may bring a temporary gain but in the long
    run of life that man will be far ahead who deals squarely and
    honestly at all times. A thoroughly honest clerk will command a
    higher salary than one of equivocal habits, while the merchant
    who has a reputation for honesty and truthfulness in regard to
    the quality and value of his goods, will on this account he
    favored with a considerable custom. The business man whose
    "word is as good as his bond" can in any emergency, control
    large amounts of capital, the use of which brings him a rich
    return, while the man who sells his neighbor's good opinion for
    a temporary gain, will find that he has discounted his future
    success, but taking an advantage at the cost of ten tines its
    value.</p>

    <h3>INDUSTRY.</h3>

    <p>No other quality can take the place of this, and no talents
    of mind, however excellent, will bring success without labor;
    persistent systematic labor. The young man who expects to find
    some royal road to success with little or no effort, or who
    imagines that his mental abilities will compensate for a lack
    of application, cheats and ruins himself. Horace Greeley
    probably never said a grander thing than this: "The saddest
    hour in any man's career is that wherein he, for the first
    time, fancies there is an easier was of gaining a dollar than
    by squarely earning it." and Horace Greeley was himself an
    example of success through industry.</p>

    <p>It is not genius, but the great mass of average people, who
    <i>work</i>, that make the successes in life. Some toil with
    the brain, and others toil with the hand, but
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"
       id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span> all must toil. Industry
       applies to hours in business and out of business. It means
       not only to perform all required work promptly, but to
       occupy spare moments usefully, not to idle evenings, and to
       rise early in the morning.</p>

    <p>An <ins class="correction"
         title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'employe'">
         employee</ins>
         should not confine himself to his mere obligatory duties.
         He should be ready to work sometimes over hours or in
         other departments if it is desired of him. Willingness to
         <i>work</i> is one of the finest qualities in a character,
         and will compensate for many other deficiencies.</p>

    <h3>MEMORY.</h3>

    <p>This faculty, always so useful, is pre-eminently so to the
    business man. It must be both retentive and quick. By proper
    training this faculty may be so cultivated that names, dates
    and events to a surprising number may be readily recalled. The
    ability to greet a customer by calling him by name is
    considered very valuable in any class of business. It makes a
    very agreeable impression when a man who has not seen us but
    once or twice, and who is not expecting us, meets us promptly
    as we enter his store, with, "Why, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, how do
    you do? Glad to see you. When did you leave Newark?" We feel as
    if we had occupied that man's thoughts since we saw him before.
    He appreciates us, and we feel like patronizing him. Whereas,
    on the other hand to meet a customer with a blank, inquiring
    expression, and greet him with, "Your face is familiar, but I
    can't recall your name." is unpleasant and tends to drive away
    custom. Every hotel keeper knows the value of this greeting of
    customers. Facts, figures and dates are very necessary to
    remember in business, and these often form the basis of a
    business transaction or venture by which large profits are
    made. Superior ability in remembering prices and their
    fluctuations has been the secret of more than one brilliant
    success.</p>

    <p>Desultory reading injures the memory, while close
    application to a subject, recalling the various points therein,
    tends greatly to improve this faculty. The clerk or employe in
    receiving instructions from his principal should endeavor to
    impress every point clearly on his mind, and retain them there
    until they are carried out in action. Carelessness and
    forgetfulness often causes the discharge of otherwise worthy
    and competent young persons, as employers do not like to repeat
    their orders.</p>

    <h3>PROMPTNESS.</h3>

    <p>A very essential element in the character of the business
    man is promptness. Filling all engagements at exactly the
    appointed time, answering letters or forwarding goods with
    promptness, the man of business finds that much more can be
    accomplished and with far greater accuracy, than by a loose
    system of putting off till to-morrow, or according to
    convenience. Not only so, but competition in business is such
    that the merchant or tradesman who does not deal with
    promptness can hardly expect to hold his custom. Young men
    starting out in the world should form the resolution of doing
    everything on time. Better to be ahead in the performance of
    duties than behind. This promptness then acts as a stimulant in
    itself, and is oftentimes the means of winning success in an
    enterprise.</p>

    <p>A thing that is worth the doing, ought to be done quickly
    when the time is ripe for it. A prompt man or woman is valued,
    as he respects his word and has due regard for the convenience
    of others.</p>

    <h3>EXECUTIVE ABILITY.</h3>

    <div class="figleft">
        <img src="images/ill066.jpg"
             alt="Pond Flourish." />
    </div>

    <p>Wavering, timid and uncertain, the man without executive
    ability never achieves distinction in active life. Intelligence
    to decide on any measure, firmness in adhering to the decision,
    and force of will in carrying it out, constitute executive
    ability, and are as essential to the business man as his stock
    in trade.</p>

    <p>The timid man never makes up his mind until after the
    opportunity is past, or decides, then recalls his decision, and
    feels incapable of promptly estimating all the facts in the
    case. This weakness is oftentimes natural, but more frequently
    it is a bad habit which should be broken up.</p>

    <p>Rashness is to decide and act without taking the trouble to
    weigh intelligently the facts in the case. This is inexcusable
    folly, and always brings serious trouble sooner or later.</p>

    <p>Through executive ability the labor or services of one man
    may be made to produce largely, or without proper direction
    such services may be almost worthless; and in the case of many
    employes under one executive head, the results of this combined
    labor may be great success, or where executive ability is
    wanting, a great failure.</p>

    <p>The successful farmer, merchant, manufacturer, banker, and
    professional man must have this combination of ability,
    firmness, and will
    power.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"
       id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span>

    <h3>PERSEVERANCE.</h3>

    <p>Those who put their minds on their work, whatever kind that
    may be, and persist in its thorough execution; who get
    interested in something for their own advancement, that they
    may become more capable as men and women of sense and tact;
    such persons have a lively appreciation of the fact that
    success is never more certain to be gained by any other
    course.</p>

    <p>These people have a just pride in learning the best methods
    of giving expression to the faculties and powers they possess,
    and which they desire to make the most of. It is incumbent that
    they do all in their power for their own and other people's
    good. Feeling this, an ever present incentive keeps them
    employed, and they are never idle.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill067.jpg"
             alt="Beehive" />
    </div>

    <p>If one does not succeed from persisting in doing the best he
    knows how, he may conclude that the ministry of failure is
    better for him than any worldly success would be.</p>

    <h3>CIVILITY.</h3>

    <p>Good behavior is an essential element of our civilization.
    It should be displayed every day through courteous acts and
    becoming manners.</p>

    <p>Politeness is said to be the poetry of conduct; and like
    poetry, it has many qualities. Let not your politeness he too
    florid, but of that gentle kind which indicates a refined
    nature.</p>

    <p>In his relations with others, one should never forget his
    good breeding. It is a general regard for the feelings of
    others that springs from the absence of all selfishness. No one
    should behave in the presence of others as though his own
    wishes were bound to be gratified or his will to control.</p>

    <p>In the more active sphere of business, as in the larger
    localities where there is close competition, the small merchant
    frequently outstrips his more powerful rival by one element of
    success, which may be added to any stock without cost, but
    cannot be withheld without loss. That element is civility. A
    kind and obliging manner carries with it an indescribable
    charm. It must not be a manner that indicates a mean,
    groveling, timeserving spirit, but a plain, open, and agreeable
    demeanor that seems to desire to oblige for the pleasure of
    doing so, and not for the sake of squeezing an extra penny out
    of a customer's purse.</p>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill068.jpg"
             alt="unidentified illustration" />
    </div>

    <h3>INTEGRITY.</h3>

    <p>The sole reliance of a business man should be in the
    integrity of his transactions, and in the civility of his
    demeanor. He should make it the interest and the pleasure of a
    customer to come to his office or store. If he does this, he
    will form the very best "connections," and so long as he
    continues this system of business, they will never desert
    him.</p>

    <p>No real business man will take advantage of a customer's
    ignorance, nor equivocate nor misrepresent. If he sells goods,
    he will have but one price and a small profit. He will ere long
    find all the most profitable customers&mdash;the cash
    ones&mdash;or they will find him.</p>

    <p>If such a man is ever deceived in business transactions, he
    will never attempt to save himself by putting the deception
    upon others; but submit to the loss, and be more cautious in
    future. In his business relations, he will stick to those whom
    he finds strictly just in their transactions, and shun all
    others even at a temporary disadvantage.</p>

    <p>The word of a business man should be worth all that it
    expresses and promises, and all engagements should be met with
    punctilious concern. An indifferent or false policy in business
    is a serious mistake. It is fatal to grasp an advantage at ten
    times its cost; and there is nothing to compensate for the loss
    of a neighbor's confidence or good will.</p>

    <p>The long-established customs and forms of business, which in
    these times are assumed to be legitimate, already have within
    them enough of the elements of peculiarity, commonly termed
    "tricks of trade," or, in the sense of any particular business,
    "tricks of the trade." Therefore it does not behoove any active
    man to make gratuitous additions of a peculiar nature to the
    law of business. On the contrary, all should strive to render
    business transactions less peculiar than they are.</p>

    <h3>ECONOMY.</h3>

    <div class="figleft">
        <img src="images/ill069.jpg"
             alt="Lake Flourish" />
    </div>

    <p>One may rest in the assurance that industry and economy will
    be sure to tell in the end. If in early life these habits
    become confirmed, no doubt can exist as to the ultimate triumph
    of the merchant in attaining a competency.</p>

    <p>There should be no antagonism between economy and a generous
    business policy. Narrow selfishness is to be avoided in the use
    of money or means. In buying goods, one should not take
    advantage of another's necessities to beat him down to a figure
    which leaves him little or no profit, perhaps a loss, because
    he must <span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"
       id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span> have money. This is against
       manhood and is a ruinous policy, because it tends to
       picayunishness and chicanery. A sacred regard for the
       principles of justice forms the basis of every transaction,
       and regulates the conduct of the upright man of
       business.</p>

    <p>If economy is wealth, it is not so because of a niggardly
    and parsimonious policy. Perhaps the simplest, fewest and best
    rules for economical business are these, by observance of which
    a noted merchant amassed a large fortune: 1. Obtain the
    earliest and fullest information possible in regard to the
    matter in hand. 2. Act rapidly and promptly upon it. 3. Keep
    your intentions and means secret. 4. Secure the best
    <ins class="correction"
         title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'employes'">
         employees</ins> you can obtain, and reward them liberally.</p>

    <p>Proprietors of institutions will early discover that order,
    and neatness, are necessary as economical agents in prosecuting
    a successful business. And the youth who would grow up to
    become well-to-do, to gain complete success, to be a valuable
    member and assume a position in society, should take pains to
    acquire habits of cleanliness, of order, and of business.</p>

    <p>To this effect each one may early learn the simple rules of
    health and good order by paying reasonable attention to those
    so-called minor details, which pertain to the well-being of the
    person, and which must be faithfully observed in order to avoid
    failure and win success.</p>

    <p>A person, young or old, in or out of business, may keep a
    memorandum-book in his pocket, in which he notes every
    particular relative to appointments, addresses, and petty cash
    matters. An accurate account of personal expenses should be
    kept, which should be balanced each week. By this means each
    individual will be more careful and economical in his
    expenditures, and generally live within his income. He must be
    reasonable in spending, or his memorandum or record-book, if it
    be honestly kept, will stand to his discredit.</p>

    <p>A well-kept memorandum-book is often very useful, as it is
    very convenient, and sometimes serves to settle a troublesome
    query, arising in other minds, by which the possessor is
    absolved from the prejudice of doubt. Young people who expect
    to labor with their hands for what they have of this world's
    goods, or rise by their own efforts, should by all means
    acquire habits of economy, learn to save, form correct habits,
    and no time will be required overcoming these. So surely as
    they do this, so surely will they be in a situation to ask no
    special favors. Every man wants to learn to look out for
    himself and rely upon himself. Every man needs to feel that he
    is the peer of every other man, and he cannot do it if he is
    penniless. Money is power, and those who have it exert a wider
    influence than the destitute. Hence it should be the ambition
    of all young men to acquire it, as well as to store their minds
    with useful knowledge.</p>

    <h3>GETTING A SITUATION.</h3>

    <div class="figright">
        <img src="images/ill070.jpg"
             alt="Plants in Urn Flourish" />
    </div>

    <p>In seeking a situation, it is always best to appear in
    person if practicable. A business man who requires the services
    of a salesman or clerk, a bookkeeper, stenographer, or some one
    to remain in his employ a considerable time, usually prefers to
    see an applicant and have a few words with him about the work
    that is to be done.</p>

    <p>If an application has to be made by letter, it should be
    done in the handwriting of the applicant. It may be brief, and
    should include references.</p>

    <p>It is best for a young man to learn a trade. In this country
    the trades offer more stable means of subsistence than do other
    departments of active life. His knowledge of a trade will form
    no bar to any effort he may afterward make to rise to a higher
    or more congenial calling.</p>

    <p>When a position has been obtained by an applicant, he should
    at once proceed to render himself indispensable to his employer
    by following up the details of his work in a conscientious and
    agreeable manner. Thus he will gain confidence and grow in
    favor with men who are quick to recognize merit, and who
    respond to that which contributes to the success of a
    meritorious man.</p>

    <p>There is always room in every business for an honest,
    hard-worker. It will not do to presume otherwise; nor should
    one sit down to grumble or concoct mischief. The most perilous
    hour of one's life is when he is tempted to despond. He who
    loses, his courage loses all. There are men in the world who
    would rather work than be idle at the same price. Imitate them.
    Success is not far off. An honorable and happy life is before
    you. Lay hold of it.</p>

    <h2>DETECTING COUNTERFEIT MONEY</h2>

    <div class="figleft">
        <img src="images/ill072.jpg"
             alt="Fancy T." />
    </div>

    <p>The desire to accumulate property is one of the noblest that
    nature has implanted in man, and it is through the successful
    results of this desire, we are enabled to point with unerring
    certainty to the disembarking line, which so surely
    characterizes the advanced educated, refined and civilized man
    from that of the wild savage, whose highest desire is to slay
    and rob his fellow men, and proudly exhibit their scalps, or
    the plunder he has acquired, as evidence of his cunning or
    courage.</p>

    <p>It is through this inborn desire to accumulate that man is
    willing to labor, toil, suffer, and forego present
    gratifications for the hope of future greater satisfactions;
    that has resulted in the building and equiping the mighty ships
    of commerce, whose white, spreading canvas dots every sea where
    commerce may be known, or where the interests of God's
    creatures may best be served. It is through this desire,
    coupled with unremitting toil, that we owe everything of
    permanent enjoyment, of enlightenment and of prosperity. The
    millions of dollars of paper money which is handled every day
    as the natural fruit of toil and saving through the many and
    diversified transactions in the vast, illimitable and ever
    rapidly developing field of commerce, is but the representative
    of ownership of property.</p>

    <p>If this representative is what it purports on its face to
    be, each and every one who receives it in exchange for services
    or commodities, owns not merely a piece of paper, with designs,
    words and promises printed or engraved thereon, but an interest
    or an undivided whole in a farm, a block of buildings or a
    store well stocked with merchandise, which, in his estimation,
    at least, is more desirable to him than the labor or commodity
    for which he has voluntarily made the exchange; but, if on the
    contrary, it is other than what it purports on its face to be,
    he finds that he is the owner of a piece of paper whose value
    is <i>nil</i>.</p>

    <p>There is, at the present writing, 1884, nearly eight hundred
    million dollars of paper currency in the United States,
    consisting of greenbacks and national currency, a great portion
    of which is in actual circulation, and it has been estimated by
    eminent authorities, who occupy positions of trust in the
    various departments through which the financial machinery of
    this vast sea of paper money is daily circulated, that there is
    in circulation nearly one-fifth of this amount in counterfeit
    money, or about one hundred and sixty million dollars; and not
    one dollar of this counterfeit money owes its circulation to
    any excellence of the work in its manufacture, but wholly to
    the general ignorance of those who handle it, as to what is
    required to constitute a genuine bill. The time will come when
    the United States will redeem all of its issue of paper money,
    when those who are holding any of this counterfeit money will
    have to stand the loss to the extent of the sum in their
    possession. To all of those who are willing to take a small
    portion of their time each day for a few weeks in learning just
    what it takes to constitute a genuine bill, there need be no
    necessity of ever losing anything by counterfeiters, as it is
    impossible for them to make bills which will in any way
    approach the beauty and exactness of the genuine ones. There is
    not at the present time, nor has there ever been in the past,
    nor will there ever be in the future, a counterfeit bill made
    that cannot be detected at sight; and the positive knowledge of
    how to know at all times when a bill is genuine and when not is
    within the reach of all those who may have the privilege of
    reading the following information or infallible
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"
       id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span> rules with a genuine desire
       to be <ins class="correction"
         title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'benefited'">
    benefitted</ins> thereby.</p>

    <h3>DEVICES AND FRAUDS.</h3>

    <p>Various devices are resorted to by a numerous gang or body
    of persons, to get on in the world without turning their
    attention to legitimate and useful employments. This class
    includes many that are not engaged in the practice of
    counterfeiting and putting forth bad money, but who make
    themselves felt in various ways through vain tricks and
    schemes, which are, to all intents and purposes, frauds.</p>

    <p>Business men are generally apt at detecting and turning off
    petty schemes, but they find it best to have the means with
    which they may deal successfully as against regular swindlers,
    forgers and counterfeiters.</p>

    <h3>COUNTERFEIT AND GENUINE WORK.</h3>

    <div class="figcenter">
        <img src="images/ill073.jpg"
             alt="Detecting Counterfeit Money" /><br />
        DETECTING COUNTERFEIT MONEY
    </div>

    <p>As indicated above, counterfeit notes are issued and put
    into the channels of circulation in abundance every year by
    those engaged in the practice of counterfeiting. These notes
    are often such good imitations of the genuine that it is quite
    difficult to discern the difference.</p>

    <p>That he may protect himself, each business man should have
    some definite knowledge of a genuine bank-note.</p>

    <p>The engraving of a genuine bank note, in most all of its
    parts, is done by machinery, and it is more exact and perfect.
    On the contrary, most all parts of counterfeit notes are done
    by hand.</p>

    <p>Counterfeiters cannot afford to purchase machinery, such as
    is used for the production of genuine notes. The cost of such
    machinery is between $100,000, and $150,000, and if it were in
    wrong hands it would be always liable to seizure and
    confiscation.</p>

    <p>In order to prevent the forgery of bank-notes, a great deal
    of ingenuity and art has been expended on their production. The
    principal features of the manufacture are described as a
    peculiar kind of paper and water mark; an elaborate design,
    printed with a peculiar kind of ink, and certain private marks,
    known only by the bank officials.</p>

    <p>The work of counterfeiters can never equal that of the
    makers of genuine notes, whose skill and facilities for
    producing the highest grade of work known to the art, are the
    best that the world affords.</p>

    <p>Unless one is somewhat learned as to the quality of
    engraving, that he may be able to distinguish a fine specimen
    of the art when he sees it, he is likely to become a victim of
    the counterfeiter's operations.</p>

    <h3>LATHE WORK.</h3>

    <p>When the genuineness of a bank-note is doubted, the Lathe
    Work on the note should first be closely scrutinized. The
    several letters of denomination, circles, ovals, and shadings
    between and around the letters in the words, etc., are composed
    of numberless extremely fine lines&mdash;inclusive of lines
    straight, curved and network. These are all regular and
    unbroken, never running into each other, and may be traced
    throughout with a magnifying glass.</p>

    <p>Without the skill or machinery, by which the genuine is
    produced, the same quality of work cannot be done. Therefore,
    in a counterfeit, the lines are imperfect, giving the paper a
    dull or hazy aspect, that may be all the better appreciated by
    comparing it with the genuine. The lines in the counterfeit
    will be found now and then irregular in size, and broken: not
    uniform in course, sometimes heavy, sometimes light: no two
    stamps or dies on the same note being exactly alike.</p>

    <p>The fine, uniform, shade-lines, with which the letters on
    the genuine are embellished, are wrought by a machine that
    cannot be reproduced by counterfeiters, nor used for other than
    legitimate purposes, by authority.</p>

    <h3>GEOMETRICAL LATHE.</h3>

    <p>The fine line is the characteristic of the various and
    beautiful figures which are seen on a genuine note. This line
    is produced by what is called the Geometrical Lathe. The
    patterns made by the geometrical lathe are of every variety of
    form. They are not engraved directly upon the bank-note plate,
    but on pieces of soft steel plate, which are afterwards
    hardened. The impressions are then transferred to a soft steel
    roller, which, in its turn, is also hardened, and the
    impressions remain there, in relief. This roller is then
    capable of transferring the same designs to the bank-note plate
    by means of the transfer press.</p>

    <p>In counterfeit engraving, the design is made directly upon
    the plate, and not by transfer, as in the production
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"
       id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span> of plates for genuine notes.
       The essential difference between the two methods of
       production is, the counterfeit is made by hand, and is
       inexact and imperfect, while the genuine is made on
       geometrical principles, and is therefore exact, artistic and
       beautiful.</p>

    <p>In all the government issues the geometric lathe work is
    liberally used. This should be studied carefully, as it
    constitutes the chief test of genuineness.</p>

    <p>Fine lines, of unerring exactness, never broken, are seen on
    the genuine medallion heads, or shields, upon which the
    designation of the note is sometimes stamped. This nicety
    cannot be given by hand, or with the use of imperfect
    machinery. By close scrutiny the lines will be found to break
    off in the pattern, or appear forked, irregular in size, and
    not well defined throughout.</p>

    <p>On most counterfeits the vignettes are not well engraved,
    and the portraits have a dull appearance; the letters are
    usually wanting in clearness; the printing is sometimes faulty,
    by which some features of the note are obscured.</p>

    <h3>RULING ENGINE WORK.</h3>

    <div class="figright">
        <img src="images/ill074.jpg"
             alt="five and ten" />
    </div>

    <p>In Ruling Engine Work, as it is called, the fine line is
    present, also. The engraving is produced and transferred in the
    same way as the geometrical lathe work. In this they are
    parallel and not in circles. Those which constitute the shading
    of letters are so fine that they form a perfectly even gray
    shade. They may be printed so that the shading will appear
    darker, but the aspect will be uniform. The spaces between
    lines are exact, whether the lines be horizontal or diagonal.
    The lines are also made crooked or wave-like, not absolutely
    parallel. Ruling engine work is generally used for shading of
    names of banks, and also for the names of town, state, etc.</p>

    <h3>VIGNETTES.</h3>

    <p>While lathe work and that of the ruling engine are
    invariably machine work, and therefore cannot be successfully
    reproduced by counterfeiters, the Vignettes are chiefly the
    work of the hands. In all genuine work they are made by first
    class artists, who are well paid for their services, and who
    therefore have no incentive to exercise their skill for
    illegitimate purposes.</p>

    <p>Sometimes water and sky are done with the ruling engine, and
    when they are, no counterfeiter can successfully imitate them.
    Fine vignettes are seldom seen on counterfeit notes. If the
    lathe and ruling engine work be genuine, an ordinary vignette
    cannot make a note counterfeit, and if that be counterfeit, no
    vignette can make the note genuine.</p>

    <p>The vignettes on genuine notes are executed by men at the
    head of their vocation, and are very life-like and beautiful.
    Counterfeit vignettes usually have a sunken and lifeless
    appearance. Genuine vignettes, as seen upon government issues,
    consist of out-door scenes, portraits, historical pictures, and
    allegorical figures. They are all exceedingly beautiful, and it
    is not likely that such work will ever be successfully
    imitated.</p>

    <h3>SOLID PRINT.</h3>

    <p>The lettering, or solid print, in genuine work is done by a
    first-class artist, who makes that kind of work his exclusive
    concern. The name of the engraving company is always engraved
    with great pains and is very accurate. It will be seen on the
    upper and lower margin of the note. This, in counterfeits, is
    not quite uniform or even. The words "one dollar," as on the
    one dollar greenbacks, are to be considered as a sample of
    solid print.</p>

    <h3>BANK-NOTE PAPER.</h3>

    <p>Bank-notes are printed upon paper composed of linen, the
    qualify of which is not always the same, and it varies in
    thickness. Therefore, the paper is not always a sure test, but
    it is important. The manufacture of this paper is a profound
    secret, as carefully kept as the combinations to the great
    vaults where the government's millions lie awaiting further
    river and harbor bills. It is made only at the Dalton mill,
    which dates back almost to colonial days. What its combinations
    are nobody knows except those intimately connected with its
    manufacture. The secret of the paper-making is jealously
    guarded, as is also the paper itself. From the moment it is
    made until it gets into the treasury vaults it is carefully
    guarded. It goes there in small iron safes, the sheets
    carefully counted, and all precautions against its loss being
    taken both by the government officials and by the express
    companies which carry
    it.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"
       id="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span>

    <h3>COUNTERFEIT SIGNATURES.</h3>

    <p>Sometimes genuine notes are stolen before they are signed;
    then the only thing about them made counterfeit is the
    signatures. Those who are familiar with the signatures of the
    officers of the bank where notes are purloined, may not be lead
    into error, as such signatures usually appear more or less
    cramped or unsteady; but there is no sure protection against a
    counterfeit of this kind for those who do not have special
    knowledge of the signatures.</p>

        UNITED STATES TREASURY BUILDING, WASHINGTON, D.C.
    </div>

    <h3>ALTERED BANK-NOTES.</h3>

    <p>Bank-notes are altered in two ways, namely: raising the
    denomination, and changing the name of a broken to that of a
    responsible bank.</p>

    <p>First, in altering a note, it is scraped until thin: then
    figures of larger denomination are pasted over. A pasted note
    may be detected by holding it up to the light, when the pasted
    parts will appear darker, as they are thicker.</p>

    <p>Second, the denomination of a note is raised by taking out a
    low one with an acid, and printing in a higher one with a
    counterfeit stamp. The ink used in genuine bank-note printing
    is a peculiar kind, and not easily to be obtained by
    counterfeiters: therefore, their printing will not appear as
    clear and bright as that of the government, which is done with
    ink of the finest quality. If the ink is black, it gives a
    clear and glossy impression, without any of that smutty
    appearance, as is sometimes seen in counterfeit bank-notes. It
    is almost impossible to imitate the green ink that is used by
    the government, and it is nearly as difficult to imitate the
    red and other colors. Counterfeit inks look dull and muddy,
    while genuine inks have a glossy appearance.</p>

    <p>In the case of a note altered by the use of acid, it may be
    noticed that the acid, by spreading more than was intended by
    the counterfeiter, has injured parts of other letters, and the
    paper will appear more or less stained by the acid.</p>

    <h3>COMPARING AND EXAMINING NOTES.</h3>

    <p>A counterfeit should be compared with one that is genuine,
    in order to familiarize one's self with the distinguishing
    features which have already been indicated.</p>

    <p>It is best to acquire the habit of giving each note as
    received a searching glance, turning it over to see the back,
    and if there be any defect, it will probably catch the eye. If
    there be the least suspicion, a critical
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"
       id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span> examination of all its parts
       should be made.</p>

    <p>In case of doubt, the lathe work should be carefully
    examined, and it may be compared with a perfectly good bill;
    then examine the shading around the letters, and search for any
    sign of alteration in the title or denomination of the note. If
    there are any medallion heads or shields, notice the lines; if
    there is any red letter work, designed to appear on both sides,
    look at the character of the work on the face, then turn the
    note and examine the back. If the printing is not exactly alike
    on both sides, but varies in any part the note is counterfeit.
    Then observe the vignettes and portraits, to see whether their
    style and perfection compare well with the work on genuine
    notes. Then examine the solid print and engravers' names, as
    well as the printing, ink, and paper. By such thorough
    examination, one can hardly be at a loss to determine the
    status of the note.</p>

    <p>Good magnifying glasses are necessary, in most instances, to
    bring out the fine lines on bank-notes. Sometimes a microscope
    of great power is required to discern the genuine line.</p>

    <h3>PIECING, ETC.</h3>

    <p>Counterfeiters sometimes make ten bills of nine by what is
    termed piecing. Thus, a counterfeit note is cut into ten pieces
    by the counterfeiter, and these pieces are used in piecing nine
    genuine bills, from each of which a piece has been cut. The
    nine genuine pieces, thus obtained, are then pasted together,
    and with the tenth counterfeit piece added, make a tenth bill,
    which is the gain.</p>

    <p>Piecing bank-bills is not a very successful practice. One
    who possesses such information as here given, can readily
    detect the difference between the counterfeit and the genuine.
    This difference is, however, made less apparent by the
    counterfeiter, who defaces the counterfeit part, so as to give
    the note a worn appearance. Counterfeiting is rendered very
    difficult in consequence of the remarkable excellence of the
    work on the government and national currency, as also from the
    difficulty of imitating the green. But this currency, if
    successfully imitated by counterfeiters, will repay large
    outlay and care, as the greenbacks pass anywhere in the nation,
    and a counterfeit may be carried to other states or sections as
    it becomes known in any particular locality. National bank
    currency may be counterfeited by preparing a plate, and then
    with simple change in the name of the bank the counterfeit can
    be adapted to the various towns where banks are located. This
    much is written, not to lessen the value of or confidence in
    the issues of the government, but to admonish the public
    against the dangers of a false security.</p>

    <h2>HOW TO ADVERTISE</h2>

    <h3>EMBRACING RULES, SUGGESTIONS, AND PRACTICAL HINTS ON THIS
    IMPORTANT SUBJECT.</h3>

    <div class="figleft">
        <img src="images/ill077.jpg"
             alt="Typesetter" />
    </div>

    <p>Volumes might be written on the necessity of, and the
    various methods employed for, advertising. Many prosperous men
    owe their success in life to judicious and liberal advertising.
    In this age of strong competition in the various avenues of
    trade, he who does not advertise his wares will probably be
    outdone by a more ambitious dealer, with perhaps a poorer
    article, who advertises liberally. People go where they are
    invited, and the merchant who advertises freely, places his
    store and windows in attractive order, and leaves the door
    open, will do far more business than he who does not cater to
    the public, is indifferent about appearances, gruff, and
    complaining of hard times.</p>

    <p>Horace Greeley laid it down as a rule that a merchant should
    advertise equal to his rent. This, like all good rules, ought
    to have exceptions. An old and well established business would
    not require so much, while a new enterprise would require more
    than this amount expended judiciously in advertising. The
    merchant should decide at the beginning of the year about, what
    amount he may expend in advertising during the year, and then
    endeavor to place that amount in the best possible manner
    before the public.</p>

    <p>An advertiser should not be discouraged too soon. Returns
    are often slow and inadequate. Time is required to familiarize
    the public with a new article or new name. Some men have given
    up in despair, when just on the eve of reaping a harvest of
    success by this means. Many of the most prosperous and wealthy
    business men in this country have at times been driven hard to
    meet their advertising bills, but they knew that this was their
    most productive outlay, and by persistently continuing it they
    weathered the storm.</p>

    <h3>NEWSPAPER ADVERTISING.</h3>

    <p>Select the newspaper which circulates among the class of
    persons desired to reach. Do not advertise a special article or
    business designed for a limited class of customers, in a
    general newspaper. Almost all trades and occupations in these
    latter days have their special journals, and these afford the
    best means of reaching that class of persons. The purpose of
    the advertiser then should be to discover, first, the character
    of a paper's circulation, and second, the extent of its
    circulation. On these two essentials may then be based an
    estimate of its value as an advertising medium. The character
    of a paper's circulation is easily determined by the quality of
    the reading matter which the paper contains, and the general
    tone imparted to it by its conductors. The extent of a paper's
    circulation bears chiefly on the rates of advertising, which,
    other things being equal, should have a direct ratio to it. The
    extent of circulation is a matter of almost constant
    misrepresentation on the part of publishers or their
    agents.</p>

    <p>As a rule, the most prominent and costly part of the paper
    is the best. In country weeklies the "local items," or next to
    them, is preferable. In city journals containing a large amount
    of reading matter, a well displayed advertisement on the
    outside pages is perhaps the best for most classes of
    business.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"
       id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span>

    <p>Place the advertisement before the public at the proper
    time, just when people are beginning to feel the need of such
    as the article advertised, as furs, when winter sets in. An
    advertisement may, however, profitably be kept before the
    public constantly, and increased or diminished as occasion
    requires.</p>

    <h3>CIRCULARS.</h3>

    <p>There are many well established firms who will not advertise
    in the newspapers at all. They believe that the same amount of
    money spent in circulars, catalogues, etc., sent direct to the
    persons whom they desire to reach, pays better than newspaper
    advertising. This is more direct, and affords the advertiser
    the opportunity of setting forth his claims more fully.
    Circulars, cards, catalogues, etc., also afford a means for the
    display of taste in their typographical arrangement and
    appearance, and often times this has as much to do in making an
    impression on the person who receives it, as the reading matter
    contained therein. The printed circular goes out to the public
    as the representative of the house; it should, therefore, in
    order to command attention and respect, have about it, an air
    of appropriateness and attraction. Such a circular will perhaps
    be carefully preserved for years, while another which was of
    not enough importance, apparently, to the proprietor or firm
    issuing it, to command their taste and skill, will soon be
    thrown aside as of no importance to the person receiving
    it.</p>

    <p>Several circulars must often be sent in order to command the
    attention and secure the custom of a person. Where circulars
    referring to the same article are repeatedly sent out, the
    attention of the person who receives them is likely to be
    arrested at last, and his response may be made in the form of
    an order.</p>

    <p>Perhaps thereafter he becomes a constant customer, buying
    himself, and recommending his friends to do likewise.</p>

    <h3>CHARTS, CALENDARS, ETC.</h3>

    <p>An important idea in advertising is to enlist the services
    of others, by making it to their interest to advertise your
    business. This is often done by sending out charts, calendars,
    etc., containing useful information, together with the
    advertisement. These, when properly arranged and prepared in an
    attractive manner, will be placed in a conspicuous place in the
    store, office, or home of the person receiving them. Railway,
    insurance, and other corporations have vied with each other in
    the elegance and attractiveness of their charts, etc., until
    they have gone into the fine arts, and spared no expense to
    captivate the public.</p>

    <h3>LETTERS.</h3>

    <p>More effectual than circulars, and nearest a personal
    interview, is a personal letter. As an advertisement the letter
    impresses itself upon the mind of the person receiving it, in
    an unusual way. A prominent firm employed clerks, and had
    written several thousand letters, at many times the cost of
    printed circulars, which they mailed throughout the country,
    calling especial attention to their line of goods. Even the two
    cent postage stamp, and the envelope being sealed, impresses
    the person receiving it with the thought that it is of
    importance, and one of the largest dry goods houses in Chicago,
    when issuing any circular which they regard as special, seal
    the envelope and place a two cent stamp thereon. They consider
    that this gives their circulars a preference over ordinary
    printed matter. Certain it is, that the public accept
    advertisements largely at the value and importance attached to
    them by their owners.</p>

    <h3>DRUMMERS AND AGENTS.</h3>

    <p>Personal effort exceeds all other means of advertising, and
    competition in many branches of business has become so strong
    in these times, and the facilities for travel so excellent,
    that large numbers of solicitors and agents traverse the
    country. Good personal address, a thorough understanding of the
    business, a knowledge of human nature, together with social
    qualities, constitute a good drummer.</p>

    <h3>HOW TO WRITE AN ADVERTISEMENT.</h3>

    <p>Before writing an advertisement, one should always place
    before his mind what is the most important thing to impress
    upon the public. If he is advertising an article of established
    trade, it is the name and location of the house selling it
    which must be the more prominent, or at least equally so with
    any other part; but if he be introducing some new article, or
    seeking to extend the sale of something little known or rare,
    these items are of far less importance, and the name of the
    article itself should be more prominent. The advertisement
    should be so constructed as to claim the attention of the
    reader, and retain that attention until he has read it through.
    "Excite but never satisfy," is the principle pursued by many
    successful advertisers.</p>

    <p>The advertisement should never contain anything repugnant to
    refined taste, and nothing grotesque or ridiculous. The most
    meaning should be condensed into the fewest possible words. The
    wording should often be changed, and an attractive typography
    should be used. It is well to choose an attractive heading,
    followed by fairly spaced paragraphs, with appropriate
    sub-heads.</p>

             alt="HOW TO BE HANDSOME" />
    </div>

    <h2>HOW TO BE HANDSOME</h2>

    <p>Where is the woman who would not be beautiful? If such there
    be&mdash;but no, she does not exist. From that memorable day
    when the Queen of Sheba made a formal call on the late lamented
    King Solomon until the recent advent of the Jersey Lily, the
    power of beauty has controlled the fate of dynasties and the
    lives of men. How to be beautiful, and consequently powerful,
    is a question of far greater importance to the feminine mind
    than predestination or any other abstract subject. If women are
    to govern, control, manage, influence and retain the adoration
    of husbands, fathers, brothers, lovers or even cousins, they
    must look their prettiest at all times.</p>

    <p>All women cannot have good features, but they can look well,
    and it is possible to a great extent to correct deformity and
    develop much of the figure. The first step to good looks is
    good health, and the first element of health is cleanliness.
    Keep clean&mdash;wash freely, bathe regularly. All the skin
    wants is leave to act, and it takes care of itself. In the
    matter of baths we do not strongly advocate a plunge in
    ice-cold water; it takes a woman with clear grit and a strong
    constitution to endure it. If a hot bath be used, let it come
    before retiring, as there is less danger of taking cold
    afterwards; and, besides, the body is weakened by the ablution
    and needs immediate rest. It is well to use a flesh-brush, and
    afterwards rinse off the soap-suds by briskly rubbing the body
    with a pair of coarse toilet gloves. The most important part of
    a bath is the drying. Every part of the body should be rubbed
    to a glowing redness, using a coarse crash towel at the finish.
    If sufficient friction can not be given, a small amount of bay
    rum applied with the palm of the hand will be found
    efficacious. Ladies who have ample leisure and who lead
    methodical lives, take a plunge or sponge bath three times a
    week, and a vapor or sun bath every day. To facilitate this
    very beneficial practice, a south or east apartment is
    desirable. The lady denudes herself, takes a seat near the
    window, and takes in the warm rays of the sun. The effect is
    both beneficial and delightful. If, however, she be of a
    restless disposition, she may dance, instead of basking, in the
    sunlight. Or, if she be not fond of dancing, she may improve
    the shining hours by taking down her hair and brushing it,
    using sulphur water, pulverized borax dissolved in alcohol, or
    some similar dressing. It would be surprising to many ladies to
    see her carefully wiping the separate locks on a clean, white
    towel until the dust of the previous day is entirely removed.
    With such care it is not necessary to wash the head, and the
    hair under this treatment is invariably good.</p>

    <p>One of the most useful articles of the toilet is a bottle of
    ammonia, and any lady who has once learned its value will never
    be without it. A few drops in the water takes the place of the
    usual amount of soap, and cleans out the pores of the skin as
    well as a bleach will do. Wash the face with a flesh-brush, and
    rub the lips well to tone their color. It is well to bathe the
    eyes before putting in the spirits, and if it is desirable to
    increase their brightness, this may be done by dashing soapsuds
    into them. Always rub the eyes, in washing, toward the nose. If
    the eyebrows are inclined to spread irregularly, pinch the
    hairs together where thickest. If they show a tendency to meet,
    this contact may be avoided by pulling out the hairs every
    morning before the toilet.</p>

    <p>The dash of Orientalism in costume and lace now turns a
    lady's attention to her eyelashes, which are worthless if not
    long and drooping. Indeed, so prevalent is the desire for this
    beautiful feature that hair-dressers and ladies' artists have
    scores of customers under treatment for invigorating their
    stunted eyelashes and eyebrows. To obtain these fringed
    curtains, anoint the roots with a balsam made of two drachms of
    nitric oxid of mercury mixed with one of leaf lard. After an
    application wash the roots with a camel's hair brush dipped in
    warm milk. Tiny scissors are used, with which the lashes are
    carefully but slightly trimmed every other day. When obtained,
    refrain from rubbing or even touching the lids with the
    finger-nails. There is more beauty in a pair of well-kept
    eyebrows and full, sweeping eyelashes than people are aware of,
    and a very inattractive and lusterless eye assumes new beauty
    when it looks out from beneath elongated fringes. Many ladies
    have a habit of rubbing the corners of their eyes to remove the
    dust that will frequently accumulate there. Unless this
    operation is done with little friction it will be found that
    the growth of hair is very spare, and in that case it will
    become necessary to pencil the barren corners. Instead of
    putting cologne water on the handkerchief, which has come to be
    considered a vulgarism among ladies of correct tastes, the
    perfume is spent on the eyebrows and lobes of the ears.</p>

    <p>If commenced in youth, thick lips may be reduced by
    compression, and thin linear ones are easily modified by
    suction. This draws the blood to the surfaces, and produces at
    first a temporary and, later, a permanent inflation. It is a
    mistaken belief that biting the lips reddens them. The skin of
    the lips is very thin, rendering them extremely susceptible to
    organic derangement, and if the atmosphere does not cause chaps
    or parchment, the result of such harsh treatment will develop
    into swelling or the formation of scars. Above all things, keep
    a sweet breath.</p>

    <p>Everybody can not have beautiful hands, but there is no
    plausible reason for their being ill kept. Red hands may be
    overcome by soaking the feet in hot water as often as possible.
    If the skin is hard and dry, use tar or oat-meal soap, saturate
    them with glycerine, and wear gloves in bed. Never bathe them
    in hot water, and wash no oftener than is necessary. There are
    dozens of women with soft, white hands who do not put them in
    water once a month. Rubber gloves are worn in making the
    toilet, and they are cared for by an ointment of glycerine and
    rubbed dry with chamois-skin or cotton flannel. The same
    treatment is not unfrequently applied to the face with the most
    successful results. If such methods are used, it would be just
    as well to keep the knowledge of it from the gentlemen. We know
    of one beautiful lady who has not washed her face for three
    years, yet it is always clean, rosy, sweet and kissable. With
    some of her other secrets she gave it to her lover for safe
    keeping. Unfortunately, it proved to be her last gift to that
    gentleman, who declared in a subsequent note that "I can not
    reconcile my heart and my manhood to a woman who can get along
    without washing her
    face."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"

    <h3>SOME OF THE SECRETS OF BEAUTY.</h3>

    <p>There is as much a "fashion" in complexion as there is in
    bonnets or boots. Sometimes nature is the mode, sometimes art.
    Just now the latter is in the ascendant, though, as a rule,
    only in that inferior phase which has not reached the
    "concealment of art"&mdash;the point where extremes meet and
    the perfection of artifice presents all the appearance of
    artlessness. No one of an observant turn of mind, who is
    accustomed to the sight of English maids and matrons, can deny
    that making-up, as at present practiced, partakes of the
    amateurish element. Impossible reds and whites grow still more
    impossibly red and white from week to week under the unskilled
    hands of the wearer of "false colors," who does not like to ask
    for advice on so delicate a subject, for, even were she willing
    to confess to the practice, the imputation of experience
    conveyed in the asking for counsel might be badly received, and
    would scarcely be in good taste.</p>

    <p>The prevalent and increasing short-sightedness of our times
    is, perhaps, partly the cause of the excessive use of rouge and
    powder. The wielder of the powder puff sees herself afar off,
    as it were. She knows that she cannot judge of the effect of
    her complexion with her face almost touching its reflection in
    the glass, and, standing about a yard off, she naturally
    accentuates her roses and lilies in a way that looks very
    pleasing to her, but is rather startling to any one with longer
    sight. Nor can she tone down her rouge with the powdered hair
    that softened the artificial coloring of her grandmother when
    she had her day. Powder is only occasionally worn with evening
    dress, and it is by daylight that those dreadful bluish reds
    and whites look their worst.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, there are some women so clever at making
    up their faces that one feels almost inclined to condone the
    practice in admiration of the result. These are the small
    minority, and are likely to remain so, for their secret is of a
    kind unlikely to be shared. The closest inspection of these
    cleverly managed complexions reveals no trace of art.</p>

    <p>Notwithstanding the reticence of these skilled artists, an
    occasional burst of confidence has revealed a few of their
    means of accomplishing the great end of looking pretty. "Do you
    often do that?" said one of those clever ones, a matron of 37,
    who looked like a girl of 19, to a friend who was vigorously
    rubbing her cheeks with a course towel after a plentiful
    application of cold water.</p>

    <p>"Yes, every time I come in from a walk, ride or drive.
    Why?"</p>

    <p>"Well, no wonder you look older than you are. You are simply
    wearing your face out!"</p>

    <p>"But I must wash?"</p>

    <p>"Certainly, but not like that. Take a leaf out of my book;
    never wash you face just before going out into the fresh air,
    or just after coming in. Nothing is more injurious to the skin.
    Come to the glass. Do you notice a drawn look about your eyes
    and a general streakiness in the cheeks? That is the result of
    your violent assault upon your complexion just now. You look at
    this moment ten years older than you did twenty minutes ago in
    the park."</p>

    <p>"Well, I really do. I look old enough to be your mother; but
    then, you are wonderful. You always look so young and
    fresh!"</p>

    <p>"Because I never treat my poor face so badly as you do
    yours. I use rain-water, and if I cannot get that, I have the
    water filtered. When I dress for dinner I always wash my face
    with milk, adding just enough hot water to make it pleasant to
    use. A very soft sponge and very fine towel take the place of
    your terrible huckaback arrangement."</p>

    <p>Two or three years ago a lady of Oriental parentage on her
    father's side spent a season in London society. Her complexion
    was brown, relieved by yellow, her features large and
    irregular, but redeemed by a pair of lovely and expressive
    eyes. So perfect was her taste in dress that she always
    attracted admiration wherever she went. Dressed in rich dark
    brown or dullest crimsons or russets, so that no one ever
    noticed much what she wore, she so managed that suggestions and
    hints&mdash;no more&mdash;of brilliant amber or
    <ins class="correction"
         title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'promegranate'">
    pomegranate</ins> scarlet should appear just where they
    imparted brilliancy to her deep coloring, and abstract the
    yellow from her skin. A knot of old gold satin under the rim of
    her bonnet, another at her throat, and others in among the lace
    at her wrists, brightened up the otherwise subdued tinting of
    her costume, so that it always looked as though it had been
    designed expressly for her by some great colorist. Here rouge
    was unnecessary. The surroundings were arranged to suit the
    complexion, instead of the complexion to suit the surroundings.
    There can be no doubt as to which is the method which best
    becomes the gentlewoman.</p>

    <p>In addition to the disagreeable sensation of making-up, it
    must be remembered that the use of some of the white powders
    eventually destroys the texture of the skin, rendering it rough
    and coarse. Rimmel, the celebrated perfumer, in his "Book of
    Perfumes," says that rouge, being composed of cochineal and
    saffron, is harmless, but that white cosmetics consist
    occasionally of deleterious substances which may injure the
    health. He advises actors and actresses to choose cosmetics,
    especially the white, with the greatest care, and women of the
    world, who wish to preserve the freshness of their complexion,
    to observe the following recipe: Open air, rest, exercise and
    cold water.</p>

    <p>In another part of this pleasant book the author says that
    <i>schonada</i>, a cosmetic used among the Arabs, is quite
    innocuous and at the same time effectual. "This cream, which
    consists of sublimated benzoin, acts upon the skin as a slight
    stimulant, and imparts perfectly natural colors during some
    hours without occasioning the inconveniences with which
    European cosmetics may justly be reproached." It is a
    well-known fact that bismuth, a white powder containing sugar
    of lead, injures the nerve-centers when constantly employed,
    and occasionally causes paralysis itself.</p>

    <p>In getting up the eyes, nothing is injurious that is not
    dropped into them. The use of <i>kohl</i> or <i>kohol</i> is
    quite harmless, and, it must be confessed, very effective when
    applied&mdash;as the famous recipe for salad dressing enjoins
    with regard to the vinegar&mdash;by the hand of a miser. Modern
    Egyptian ladies make their <i>kohol</i> of the smoke produced
    by burning almonds. A small bag holding the bottle of
    <i>kuhol</i>, and a pin, with a rounded point with which to
    apply it, form part of the toilet paraphernalia of all the
    beauties of Cairo, who make the immense mistake of getting up
    their eyes in an exactly similar manner, thus trying to reduce
    the endless variety of nature to one common pattern, a mistake
    that may be accounted for by the fact that the Arabs believe
    <i>kohol</i> to be a sovereign specific against ophthalmia.
    Their English sisters often make the same mistake without the
    same excuse. A hairpin steeped in lampblack is the usual method
    of darkening the eyes in England, retribution following sooner
    or later in the shape of a total loss of the eyelashes. Eau de
    Cologne is occasionally dropped into the eyes, with the effect
    of making them brighter. The operation is painful, and it is
    said that half a dozen drops of whisky and the same quantity of
    Eau de Cologne, eaten on a lump of sugar, is quite as
    effective.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"
       id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span>

    <h3>HIGH-HEELED BOOTS.</h3>

    <p>A lady looks infinitely taller and slimmer in a long dress
    than she does in a short costume, and there is always a way of
    showing the feet, if desired, by making the front quite short,
    which gives, indeed, a more youthful appearance to a train
    dress. The greatest attention must, of course, be paid to the
    feet with these short dresses, and I may here at once state
    that high heels are absolutely forbidden by fashion. Doctors,
    are you content? Only on cheap shoes and boots are they now
    made, and are only worn by common people. A good bootmaker will
    not make high heels now, even if paid double price to do so.
    Ladies&mdash;that is, real ladies&mdash;now wear flat-soled
    shoes and boots, <i>a la</i> Cinderella. For morning walking,
    boots or high Moliere shoes are worn.</p>

    <p>If you wear boots you may wear any stockings you like, for
    no one sees them. But if you wear shoes you must adapt your
    stockings to your dress. Floss silk, Scotch thread, and even
    cotton stockings are worn for walking, silk stockings have
    returned into exclusively evening wear. Day stockings should be
    of the same color as the dress, but they may be shaded, or
    stripped, or dotted, just as you please. White stockings are
    absolutely forbidden for day wear&mdash;no one wears
    them&mdash;no one dares wear them under fashion's
    interdiction.</p>

    <h3>HOW TO APPEAR GRACEFUL IN WALKING.</h3>

    <p>The whole secret of standing and walking erect consists in
    keeping the chin well away from the breast. This throws the
    head upward and backward, and the shoulders will naturally
    settle backward and in their true position. Those who stoop in
    walking generally look downward. The proper way is to look
    straight ahead, upon the same level with your eyes, or if you
    are inclined to stoop, until that tendency is overcome, look
    rather above than below the level. Mountaineers are said to be
    as "straight as an arrow," and the reason is because they are
    obliged to look upward so much. It is simply impossible to
    stoop in walking if you will heed and practice this rule. You
    will notice that all round-shouldered persons carry the chin
    near the breast and pointed downward. Take warning in time, and
    heed grandmother's advice, for a bad habit is more easily
    prevented than cured. The habit of stooping when one walks or
    stands is a bad habit and especially hard to cure.</p>

    <h3>HISTORY OF THE BIBLES OF THE WORLD.</h3>

    <p>The Bibles of the world are the koran of the Mohammedans,
    the tripitaka of the Buddhists, the five kings of the Chinese,
    the three vedas of the Hindoos, the zendavesta of the Parsees
    and the scriptures of the Christians. The koran, says the
    Chicago Times, is the most recent, dating from the seventh
    century after Christ. It is a compound of quotations from both
    the Old and the New Testaments and from the talmud. The
    tripitaka contain sublime morals and pure aspirations. Their
    author lived and died in the sixth century before Christ.</p>

    <p>The sacred writings of the Chinese are called the five
    kings, the word "king" meaning web of cloth. From this it is
    presumed that they were originally written on five rolls of
    cloth. They contain wise sayings from the sages on the duties
    of life, but they can not be traced further back than the
    eleventh century before our era. The vedas are the most ancient
    books in the language of the Hindoos, but they do not,
    according to late commentators, antedate the twelfth before the
    Christian era. The zendaveata of the Parsees, next to our
    Bible, is reckoned among scholars as being the greatest and
    most learned of the sacred writings. Zoroaster, whose sayings
    it contains, lived and worked in the twelfth century before
    Christ. Moses lived and wrote the pentateuch 1,500 years before
    the birth of Jesus, therefore that portion of our Bible is at
    least 300 years older than the most ancient of other sacred
    writings. The eddas, a semi-sacred work of the Scandinavians,
    was first given to the world in the fourteen century A.D.</p>

    <h3>HOW TO MEASURE CORN IN THE CRIB.</h3>

    <p>Rule: 1st. Measure the length, breadth and height of the
    crib inside the rail; multiply them together and divide by two,
    the result is the number of bushels of shelled corn.</p>

    <p>2d. Level the corn so that it is of equal depth throughout,
    multiply the length, breath and depth together, and this
    product by four, and cut off one figure to the right of the
    product; the other will represent the number of bushels of
    shelled corn.</p>

    <p>3d. Multiply length by height, and then by width, add two
    ciphers to the result and divide by 124; this gives the number
    of bushels of ear
    corn.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"

    <h3>HOME DRESSMAKING.</h3>

    <p>The art of dressmaking in America has been of late years so
    simplified that almost anyone with a reasonable degree of
    executive ability can manufacture a fashionable costume by
    using an approved pattern and following the directions printed
    upon it, selecting a new pattern for each distinct style; while
    in Europe many ladies adhere to the old plan of cutting one
    model and using it for everything, trusting to personal skill
    or luck to gain the desired formation. However, some useful
    hints are given which are well worth offering after the paper
    pattern has been chosen.</p>

    <p>The best dressmakers here and abroad use silk for lining,
    but nothing is so durable or preserves the material as well as
    a firm slate twill. This is sold double width and should be
    laid out thus folded: place the pattern upon it with the upper
    part towards the cut end, the selvedge for the fronts. The side
    pieces for the back will most probably be got out of the width,
    while the top of the back will fit in the intersect of the
    front. A yard of good stuff may be often saved by laying the
    pattern out and well considering how one part cuts into
    another. Prick the outline on to the lining; these marks serve
    as a guide for the tacking.</p>

    <p>In forming the front side plaits be careful and do not allow
    a fold or crease to be apparent on the bodice beyond where the
    stitching commences. To avoid this, before beginning stick a
    pin through what is to be the top of the plait. The head will
    be on the right side, and holding the point, one can begin
    pinning the seam without touching the upper part of the bodice.
    To ascertain the size of the buttonholes put a piece of card
    beneath the button to be used and cut it an eighth of an inch
    on either side beyond. Having turned down the piece in front on
    the buttonhole side run a thread a sixteenth of an inch from
    the extreme edge, and again another the width of the card.
    Begin to cut the first buttonhole at the bottom of the bodice;
    and continue at equal distances. The other side of the bodice
    is left wide enough to come well under the buttonholes. The
    buttonholes must be laid upon it and a pin put through the
    center of each to mark where the button is to be placed. In
    sewing on the buttons put the stiches in horizontally; if
    perpendicularly they are likely to pucker that side of the
    bodice so much that it will be quite drawn up, and the buttons
    will not match the buttonholes.</p>

    <h3>A WOMAN'S SKIRTS.</h3>

    <p>Observe the extra fatigue which is insured to every woman in
    merely carrying a tray upstairs, from the skirts of the dress.
    Ask any young women who are studying to pass examinations
    whether they do not find loose clothes a <i>sine qua non</i>
    while poring over their books, and then realize the harm we are
    doing ourselves and the race by habitually lowering our powers
    of life and energy in such a manner. As a matter of fact it is
    doubtful whether any persons have ever been found who would say
    that their stays were at all tight; and, indeed, by a muscular
    contraction they can apparently prove that they are not so by
    moving them about on themselves, and thus probably believe what
    they say. That they are in error all the same they can easily
    assure themselves by first measuring round the waist outside
    the stays; then take them off, let them measure while they take
    a deep breath, with the tape merely laid on the body as if
    measuring for the quantity of braid to go round a dress, and
    mark the result. The injury done by stays is so entirely
    internal that it is not strange that the maladies caused by
    wearing them should be attributed to every reason under the sun
    except the true one, which is, briefly, that all the internal
    organs, being by them displaced, are doing their work
    imperfectly and under the least advantageous conditions: and
    are, therefore, exactly in the state most favorable to the
    development of disease, whether hereditary or
    otherwise.&mdash;<i>Macmillan's Magazine.</i></p>

    <h3>TO MAKE THE SLEEVES.</h3>

    <p>As to sleeves. Measure from the shoulder to the elbow and
    again from elbow to the wrist. Lay these measurements on any
    sleeve patterns you may have, and lengthen and shorten
    accordingly. The sleeve is cut in two pieces, the top of the
    arm and the under part, which is about an inch narrower than
    the outside. In joining the two together, if the sleeve is at
    all tight, the upper part is slightly fulled to the lower at
    the elbow. The sleeve is sewn to the armhole with no cordings
    now, and the front seam should be about two inches in front of
    the bodice.</p>

    <p>Bodices are now worn very tight-fitting, and the French
    stretch the material well on the cross before beginning to cut
    out, and in cutting allow the lining to be slightly pulled, so
    that when on, the outside stretches to it and insures a better
    fit. An experienced eye can tell a French-cut bodice at once,
    the front side pieces being always on the cross. In dress
    cutting and fitting, as in everything else, there are failures
    and discouragements, but practice overrules these little
    matters, and "trying again" brings a sure reward in
    success.</p>

    <p>A sensible suggestion is made in regard to the finish in
    necks of dresses for morning wear. Plain colors have rather a
    stiff appearance, tulle or crepe lisse frilling are expensive
    and frail, so it is a good idea to purchase a few yards of
    really good washing lace, about an inch and a half in depth;
    quill or plait and cut into suitable lengths to tack around the
    necks of dresses. This can be easily removed and cleaned when
    soiled. A piece of soft black Spanish lace, folded loosely
    around the throat close to the frillings, but below it, looks
    very pretty; or you may get three yards of scarf lace, trim the
    ends with frillings, place it around the neck, leaving nearly
    all the length in the right hand, the end lying upon the left
    shoulder being about half a yard long. Wind the larger piece
    twice around the throat, in loose, soft folds, and festoon the
    other yard and a half, and fasten with brooch or flower at the
    side.&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Times.</i></p>

    <h3>DISCOVERY OF GOLD IN CALIFORNIA.</h3>

    <p>It was on the 19th day of January, 1848, that James W.
    Marshall, while engaged in digging a race for a saw-mill at
    Coloma, about thirty-five miles eastward from Sutter's Fort,
    found some pieces of yellow metal, which he and the half-dozen
    men working with him at the mill supposed to be gold. He felt
    confident that he had made a discovery of great importance, but
    he knew nothing of either chemistry or gold-mining, so he could
    not prove the nature of the metal nor tell how to obtain it in
    paying quantities. Every morning he went down to the race to
    look for the bits of metal; but the other men at the mill
    thought Marshall was very wild in his ideas, and they continued
    their labors in building the mill, and in sowing wheat and
    planting vegetables. The swift current of the mill-race washed
    away a considerable body of earthy matter, leaving the coarse
    particles of gold behind; so Marshall's collection of specimens
    continued to accumulate, and his associates began to think
    there might be something in his gold mines after all. About the
    middle of February, a Mr. Bennett, one of the party employed at
    the mill, went to San Francisco for the purpose of learning
    whether this metal was precious, and there he was introduced to
    Isaac Humphrey, who had washed for gold in Georgia. The
    experienced miner saw at a glance that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"
       id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span> he had the true stuff before
       him, and, after a few inquiries, he was satisfied that the
       diggings must be rich. He made immediate preparation to
       visit the mill, and tried to persuade some of his friends to
       go with him; but they thought it would be only a waste of
       time and money, so he went with Bennett for his sole
       companion.</p>

    <p>He arrived at Coloma on the 7th of March, and found the work
    at the mill going on as if no gold existed in the neighborhood.
    The next day he took a pan and spade, and washed some of the
    dirt in the bottom of the mill-race in places where Marshall
    had found his specimens, and, in a few hours, Humphrey declared
    that these mines were far richer than any in Georgia. He now
    made a rocker and went to work washing gold industriously, and
    every day yielded to him an ounce or two of metal. The men at
    the mill made rockers for themselves, and all were soon busy in
    search of the yellow metal. Everything else was abandoned; the
    rumor of the discovery spread slowly. In the middle of March
    Pearson B. Reading, the owner of a large ranch at the head of
    the Sacramento valley, happened to visit Sutter's Fort, and
    hearing of the mining at Coloma, he went thither to see it. He
    said that if similarity of formation could be taken as a proof,
    there must be gold mines near his ranch; so, after observing
    the method of washing, he posted off, and in a few weeks he was
    at work on the bars of Clear Creek, nearly two hundred miles
    northwestward from Coloma. A few days after Reading had left,
    John Bidwell, now representative of the northern district of
    the State in the lower House of Congress, came to Coloma, and
    the result of his visit was that, in less than a month, he had
    a party of Indians from his ranch washing gold on the bars of
    Feather River, twenty-five miles northwestward from Coloma.
    Thus the mines were opened at far distant points.</p>

    <p>The first printed notice of the discovery of gold was given
    in the California newspaper published in San Francisco on the
    10th of March. On the 29th of May the same paper, announcing
    that its publication would be suspended, says: "The whole
    country, from San Francisco to Los Angeles, and from the
    seashore to the base of the Sierra Nevada, resound the sordid
    cry of <i>gold! gold! gold!</i> while the field is left half
    planted, the house half built and everything neglected but the
    manufacture of pick and shovels, and the means of
    transportation to the spot where one man obtained one hundred
    and twenty-eight dollars' worth of the real stuff in one day's
    washing; and the average for all concerned, is twenty dollars
    per diem. The first to commence quartz mining in California
    were Capt. Win. Jackson and Mr. Eliason, both Virginians, and
    the first machine used was a Chilian mill.</p>

    <p>The Reid Mine, in North Carolina, was the first gold mine
    discovered and worked in the United States, and the only one in
    North America from which, up to 1825, gold was sent to the
    Mint.</p>

    <h3>HOW TO MAKE ARTIFICIAL GOLD.</h3>

    <p>The following oroid or imitation gold is sometimes sold for
    the genuine article which it closely resembles. Pure copper,
    100 parts by weight, is melted in a crucible, and then 6 parts
    of magnesia, 3.6 of sal-ammoniac, 1.8 of quicklime and 9. of
    tartar are added separately and gradually in the form of
    powder. The whole is then stirred for about half an hour, and
    17 parts of zinc or tin in small grains are thrown in and
    thoroughly mixed. The <ins class="correction"
         title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'cruicible'">
    crucible</ins> is now covered and the mixture kept melted for
    half an hour longer, when it is skimmed and poured out.</p>

    <p>Any imitation of gold may be detected by its weight, which
    is not one-half of what it should be, and by its dissolving in
    nitric acid while pure gold is untouched.</p>

    <h3>HOW TO TELL ANY PERSON'S AGE.</h3>

    <p>There is a good deal of amusement in the following magical
    table of figures. It will enable you to tell how old the young
    ladies are. Just hand this table to a young lady, and request
    her to tell you in which column or columns her age is
    contained, and add together the figures at the top of the
    columns in which her age is found, and you have the great
    secret. Thus, suppose her age to be 17, you will find that
    number in the first and fifth columns; add the first figures of
    these two columns.</p>

    <p>Here is the magic table:</p>

    <p>These amounts, with others of minor importance, consume the
    entire appropriations.</p>

    <h3>BUSINESS LAW.</h3>

    <p>Ignorance of the law excuses no one. It is a fraud to
    conceal a fraud. The law compels no one to do impossibilities.
    An agreement without consideration is void. Signatures made
    with a lead pencil are good in law. A receipt for money paid is
    not legally conclusive. The acts of one partner bind all the
    others. Contracts made on Sunday cannot be enforced. A contract
    made with a minor is void. A contract made with a lunatic is
    void. Principals are responsible for the acts of their
    agents.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"
       id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span>

    <p>Agents are responsible to their principals for errors. Each
    individual in a partnership is responsible for the whole amount
    of the debts of the firm. A note given by a minor is void.
    Notes bear interest only when so stated. It is legally
    necessary to say on a note "for value received." A note drawn
    on Sunday is void. A note obtained by fraud, or from a person
    in a state of intoxication, cannot be collected. If a note be
    lost or stolen, it does not release the maker; he must pay it.
    An endorser of a note is exempt from liability if not served
    with notice of its dishonor within twenty-four hours of its
    non-payment.</p>

    <h3>ITEMS WORTH REMEMBERING.</h3>

    <p>A sun bath is of more worth than much warming by the
    fire.</p>

    <p>Books exposed to the atmosphere keep in better condition
    than if confined in a book-case. Pictures are both for use and
    ornament. They serve to recall pleasant memories and scenes;
    they harmonize with the furnishing of the rooms. If they serve
    neither of these purposes they are worse than useless; they
    only help fill space which would look better empty, or gather
    dust and make work to keep them clean.</p>

    <p>A room filled with quantities of trifling ornaments has the
    look of a bazaar and displays neither good taste nor good
    sense. Artistic excellence aims to have all the furnishings of
    a high order of workmanship combined with simplicity, while
    good sense understands the folly of dusting a lot of
    rubbish.</p>

    <p>A poor book had best be burned to give place to a better, or
    even to an empty shelf, for the fire destroys its poison, and
    puts it out of the way of doing harm.</p>

    <p>Better economize in the purchasing of furniture or carpets
    than scrimp in buying good books or papers.</p>

    <p>Our sitting-rooms need never be empty of guests or our
    libraries of society if the company of good books is admitted
    to them.</p>

    <h3>REMARKABLE CALCULATIONS REGARDING THE SUN.</h3>

    <p>The sun's average distance from the earth is about
    91,500,000 miles. Since the orbit of the earth is elliptical,
    and the sun is situated at one of its foci, the earth is nearly
    3,000,000 miles further from the sun in aphelion than in
    perihelion. As we attempt to locate the heavenly bodies in
    space, we are immediately startled by the enormous figures
    employed. The first number, 91,500,000 miles, is far beyond our
    grasp. Let us try to comprehend it. If there were air to convey
    a sound from the sun to the earth, and a noise could be made
    loud enough to pass that distance it would require over
    fourteen years for it to come to us. Suppose a railroad could
    be built to the sun. An express train traveling day and night
    at the rate of thirty miles an hour, would require 341 years to
    reach its destination. Ten generations would be born and would
    die; the young men would become gray haired, and their
    great-grandchildren would forget the story of the beginning of
    that wonderful journey, and could find it only in history, as
    we now read of Queen Elizabeth or of Shakespeare; the eleventh
    generation would see the solar depot at the end of the route.
    Yet this enormous distance of 91,500,000 miles is used as the
    unit for expressing celestial distances&mdash;as the foot-rule
    for measuring space; and astronomers speak of so many times the
    sun's distance as we speak of so many feet or inches.</p>

    <p><b>SIGNS OF STORMS APPROACHING.</b>&mdash;A ring around the
    sun or moon stands for an approaching storm, its near or
    distant approach being indicated by its larger or smaller
    circumference. When the sun rises brightly and immediately
    afterward becomes veiled with clouds, the farmer distrusts the
    day. Rains which begin early in the morning often stop by nine
    in place of "eleven," the hour specified in the old saw, "If it
    rains before seven."</p>

    <p>On a still, quiet day, with scarcely the least wind afloat,
    the ranchman or farmer can tell the direction of impending
    storm by cattle sniffing the air in the direction whence it is
    coming. Lack of dew in summer is a rain sign. Sharp white
    frosts in autumn and winter precede damp weather, and we will
    stake our reputation as a prophet that three successive white
    frosts are an infallible sign of rain. Spiders do not spin
    their webs out of doors before rain. Previous to rain flies
    sting sharper, bees remain in their hives or fly but short
    distances, and almost all animals appear uneasy.</p>

    <h3>HOW TO DISTINGUISH GOOD MEAT FROM BAD MEAT.</h3>

    <p>1st. It is neither of a pale pink color nor of a deep purple
    tint, for the former is a sign of disease, and the latter
    indicates that the animal has not been slaughtered, but has
    died with the blood in it, or has suffered from acute
    fever.</p>

    <p>2d. It has a marked appearance from the ramifications of
    little veins of fat among the muscles.</p>

    <p>3d. It should be firm and elastic to the touch and should
    scarcely moisten the fingers&mdash;bad meat being wet and
    sodden and flabby with the fat looking like jelly or wet
    parchment.</p>

    <p>4th. It should have little or no odor, and the odor should
    not be disagreeable, for diseased meat has a sickly cadaverous
    smell, and sometimes a smell of physic. This is very
    discoverable when the meat is chopped up and drenched with warm
    water.</p>

    <p>5th. It should not shrink or waste much in cooking.</p>

    <p>6th. It should not run to water or become very wet on
    standing for a day or two, but should, on the contrary, dry
    upon the surface.</p>

    <p>7th. When dried at a temperature of 212 deg., or
    thereabouts, it should not lose more than from 70 to 74 per
    cent. of its weight, whereas bad meat will often lose as much
    as 80 per cent. The juice of the flesh is alkaline or neutral
    to test paper.</p>

    <h3>RAILROADS IN FINLAND.</h3>

    <p>People who think of Finland as a sub-arctic country of bleak
    and forbidding aspect maybe surprised to hear that several
    railroads have already made a large part of the region
    accessible. A new line, 160 miles long, has just been opened to
    the heart of the country in the midst of great forests and
    perhaps the most wonderful lake region in the world. Sportsmen
    are now within less than a day's journey from St. Petersburg of
    central Finland, where there is the best of hunting and fishing
    and twenty hours of sunlight every summer day. The most unique
    of railroads, however, is still the little line in Norway,
    north of the arctic circle, carrying the product of far
    northern mines to the sea, and famous as the only railroad that
    has yet invaded the polar regions.</p>

    <h3>COMPARATIVE SIZE OF THE ARK AND THE GREAT EASTERN.</h3>

    <p>The following comparison between the size of Noah's ark and
    the Great Eastern, both being considered in point of tonnage,
    after the old law for calculating the tonnage of a vessel,
    exhibits a remarkable similarity. The cubit of the Bible,
    according to Sir Isaac Newton, is 20-1/2 inches,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"
       id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span> or, to be exact, 20.625
       inches. Bishop Wilkins makes the cubit 20.88 inches.
       According to Newton the dimensions of the ark were: Length
       between perpendiculars, 515.62 feet; breadth, 84.94 feet;
       depth, 51.56 feet; keel, or length for tonnage, 464.08 feet.
       Tonnage, according to old law, 18,231 58-94. The
       measurements of the ark, according to Wilkins' calculations
       were: Length, 54700 feet; breadth, 91.16 feet; depth, 54.70
       feet; keel, 492.31 feet. Tonnage, 21,761. Notice how
       surprisingly near the Great Eastern came to being
       constructed after the same plan: Length, 680 feet; breadth,
       83 feet; depth, 60 feet; keel, 630 feet. Tonnage,
       23,092.</p>

    <h3>FINGER NAILS AS AN INDICATION OF CHARACTER.</h3>

    <p>A white mark on the nail bespeaks misfortune.</p>

    <p>Pale or lead-colored nails indicate melancholy people.</p>

    <p>Broad nails indicate a gentle, timid, and bashful
    nature.</p>

    <p>Lovers of knowledge and liberal sentiments have round
    nails.</p>

    <p>People with narrow nails are ambitious and quarrelsome.</p>

    <p>Small nails indicate littleness of mind, obstinacy and
    conceit.</p>

    <p>Choleric, martial men, delighting in war, have red and
    spotted nails.</p>

    <p>Nails growing into the flesh at the points or sides indicate
    luxurious tastes.</p>

    <p>People with very pale nails are subject to much infirmity of
    the flesh and persecution by neighbors and friends.</p>

    <h3>DANGERS OF CELLULOID.</h3>

    <p>A curious accident, which happened recently in Paris, points
    out a possible danger in the wearing of combs and bracelets of
    celluloid. A little girl sat down before the fire to prepare
    her lessons. Her hair was kept back by a semi-circle comb of
    celluloid. As her head was bent forward to the fire this became
    warm, and suddenly burst into flames. The child's hair was
    partly burned off, and the skin of the head was so injured that
    several months after, though the burn was healed, the cicatrix
    formed a white patch on which no hair would grow. The burning
    point of celluloid is about 180 degrees, and the comb worn by
    the girl had attained that heat as it was held before the
    fire.</p>

    <h3>ODD FACTS ABOUT SHOES.</h3>

    <p>Grecian shoes were peculiar in reaching to the middle of the
    legs.</p>

    <p>The present fashion of shoes was introduced into England in
    1633.</p>

    <p>In the ninth and tenth centuries the greatest princes of
    Europe wore wooden shoes.</p>

    <p>Slippers were in use before Shakespeare's time, and were
    originally made "rights" and "lefts."</p>

    <p>Shoes among the Jews were made of leather, linen, rush or
    wood; soldiers' shoes were sometimes made of brass or iron.</p>

    <p>In the reign of William Rufus of England, in the eleventh
    century, a great beau, "Robert, the Horned," used shoes with
    sharp points, stuffed with tow, and twisted like rams'
    horns.</p>

    <p>The Romans made use of two kinds of shoes&mdash;the solea,
    or sandal, which covered the sole of the foot, and was worn at
    home and in company, and the calceus, which covered the whole
    foot and was always worn with the toga when a person went
    abroad.</p>

    <p>In the reign of Richard II., shoes were of such absurd
    length as to require to be supported by being tied to the knees
    with chains, sometimes of gold and silver. In 1463 the English
    parliament took the matter in hand and passed an act forbidding
    shoes with spikes more than two inches in length being worn and
    manufactured.</p>

    buying, for instance, a dozen hats, knows exactly what one of
    these hats will retail for in the market where
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"
       id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span> he deals; and unless he is a
       good accountant, it will often take him some time to
       determine whether he can afford to purchase the dozen hats
       and make a living profit by selling them by the single hat;
       and in buying his goods by auction, as the merchant often
       does, he has not time to make the calculation before the
       goods are bid off. He therefore loses the chance of making
       good bargains by being afraid to bid at random, or if he
       bids, and the goods are cried off, he may have made a poor
       bargain by bidding thus at a venture. It then becomes a
       useful and practical problem to determine instantly what per
       cent. he would gain if he retailed the hat at a certain
       price, to tell what an article should retail for to make a
       profit of 20 per cent.</p>

    <p><i>Rule.&mdash;Divide what the articles cost per dozen by
    10. which is done by removing the decimal point one place to
    the left.</i></p>

    <p>For instance, if hats cost $17.50 per dozen, remove the
    decimal point one place to the left, making $1.75, what they
    should be sold for apiece to gain 20 per cent, on the cost. If
    they cost $31.00 per dozen, they should be sold at $3.10
    apiece, etc.</p>

    <h3>SOLUBLE GLASS FOR FLOORS.</h3>

    <p>Instead of the old-fashioned method of using wax for
    polishing floors, etc., soluble glass is now employed to great
    advantage. For this purpose the floor is first well cleaned,
    and then the cracks well filled up with a cement of water-glass
    and powdered chalk or gypsum. Afterward, a water-glass of
    60&deg; to 65&deg;, of the thickness of syrup, is applied by
    means of a stiff brush. Any desired color may be imparted to
    the floor in a second coat of the water-glass, and additional
    coats are to be given until the requisite polish is obtained. A
    still higher finish may be given by pummicing off the last
    layer, and then putting on a coating of oil.</p>

    <h3>DURABILITY OF A HORSE.</h3>

    <p>A horse will travel 400 yards in 4-1/2 minutes at a walk,
    400 yards in 2 minutes at a trot, and 400 yards in minute at a
    gallop. The usual work of a horse is taken at 22,500 lbs.
    raised 1 foot per minute, for 8 hours per day. A horse will
    carry 250 lbs. 25 miles per day of 8 hours. An average
    draught-horse will draw 1600 lbs. 23 miles per day on a level
    road, weight of wagon included. The average weight of a horse
    is 1000 lbs.; his strength is equal to that of 5 men. In a
    horse mill moving at 3 feet per second, track 25 feet diameter,
    he exerts with the machine the power of 4-1/2 horses. The
    greatest amount a horse can pull in a horizontal line is 900
    lbs.; but he can only do this momentarily, in continued
    exertion, probably half of this is the limit. He attains his
    growth in 5 years, will live 25, average 16 years. A horse will
    live 25 days on water, without solid food, 17 days without
    eating or drinking, but only 5 days on solid food, without
    drinking.</p>

    <p>A cart drawn by horses over an ordinary road will travel 1.1
    miles per hour of trip. A 4-horse team will haul from 25 to 30
    cubic feet of lime stone at each load. The time expended in
    loading, unloading, etc., including delavs, averages 35 minutes
    per trip. The cost of loading and unloading a cart, using a
    horse cram at the quarry, and unloading by hand, when labor is
    $1.25 per day, and a horse 75 cents, is 25 cents per
    perch&mdash;24.75 cubic feet. The work done by an animal is
    greatest when the velocity with which he moves is 1/8 of the
    greatest with which he can move when not impeded, and the force
    then exerted .45 of the utmost force the animal can exert at a
    dead pull.</p>

    <h3>COMPARATIVE COST OF FREIGHT BY WATER AND RAIL.</h3>

    <p>It has been proved by actual test that a single tow-boat can
    transport at one trip from the Ohio to New Orleans 29,000 tons
    of coal, loaded in barges. Estimating in this way the boat and
    its tow, worked by a few men, carries as much freight to its
    destination as 3,000 cars and 100 locomotives, manned by 600
    men, could transport.</p>

    <h3>HINTS TO YOUNG HOUSEWIVES.</h3>

    <p>Glycerine does not agree with a dry skin.</p>

    <p>If you use powder always wash it off before going to
    bed.</p>

    <p>When you give your cellar its spring cleaning, add a little
    copperas water and salt to the whitewash.</p>

    <p>A little ammonia and borax in the water when washing
    blankets keeps them soft and prevents shrinkage.</p>

    <p>Sprinkling salt on the top and at the bottom of garden walls
    is said to keep snails from climbing up or down.</p>

    <p>For relief from heartburn or dyspepsia, drink a little cold
    water in which has been dissolved a teaspoonful of salt.</p>

    <p>For hoarseness, beat a fresh egg and thicken it with fine
    white sugar. Eat of it freely and the hoarseness will soon be
    relieved.</p>

    <p>If quilts are folded or rolled tightly after washing, then
    beaten with a rolling pin or potato masher, it lightens up the
    cotton and makes them seem soft and new.</p>

    <p>Chemists say that it takes more than twice as much sugar to
    sweeten preserves, sauce, etc., if put in when they begin to
    cook as it does to sweeten after the fruit is cooked.</p>

    <p>Tar may be removed from the hands by rubbing with the
    outside of fresh, orange or lemon peel and drying immediately.
    The volatile oils dissolve the tar so that it can be rubbed
    off.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"
       id="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span>

    <p>Moths or any summer flying insects may be enticed to
    destruction by a bright tin pan half filled with kerosene set
    in a dark corner of the room. Attracted by the bright pan, the
    moth will meet his death in the kerosene.</p>

    <p>It may be worth knowing that water in which three or four
    onions have been boiled, applied with a gilding brush to the
    frames of pictures and chimney glasses, will prevent flies from
    lighting on them and will not injure the frames.</p>

    <h3>SUPERSTITIONS REGARDING BABIES.</h3>

    <p>It is believed by many that if a child cries at its birth
    and lifts up only one hand, it is born to command. It is
    thought very unlucky not to weigh the baby before it is
    dressed. When first dressed the clothes should not be put on
    over the head, but drawn on over the feet, for luck. When first
    taken from the room in which it was born it must be carried up
    stairs before going down, so that it will rise in the world. In
    any case it must be carried up stairs or up the street, the
    first time it is taken out. It is also considered in England
    and Scotland unlucky to cut the baby's nails or hair before it
    is twelve months old. The saying:</p>

    <p class="i6">Born on Monday, fair in the face;<br />
    Born on Tuesday, full of God's grace;<br />
    Born on Wednesday, the best to be had;<br />
    Born on Thursday, merry and glad;<br />
    Born on Friday, worthily given;<br />
    Born on Saturday, work hard for a living;<br />
    Born on Sunday, shall never know want,</p>

    <p>is known with various changes all over the Christian world;
    one deviation from the original makes Friday's child "free in
    giving." Thursday has one very lucky hour just before
    sunrise.</p>

    <p class="i6">The child that is born on the Sabbath day<br />
    Is bonny and good and gay,</p>

    <p>While</p>

    <p class="i6">He who is born on New Year's morn<br />
    Will have his own way as sure as you're born.</p>

    <p>And</p>

    <p class="i6">He who is born on Easter morn<br />
    Shall never know care, or want, or harm.</p>

    <h3>SECRET ART OF CATCHING FISH.</h3>

    <p>Put the oil of rhodium on the bait, when fishing with a
    hook, and you will always succeed.</p>

    <h3>TO CATCH FISH.</h3>

    <p>Take the juice of smallage or lovage, and mix with any kind
    of bait. As long as there remain any kind of fish within yards
    of your hook, you will find yourself busy pulling them out.</p>

    <h3>CERTAIN CURE FOR DRUNKENNESS.</h3>

    <p>Take of sulphate of iron 5 grains, magnesia 10 grains,
    peppermint water 11 drachms, spirits of nutmeg 1 drachm.
    Administer this twice a day. It acts as a tonic and stimulant
    and so partially supplies the place of the accustomed liquor,
    and prevents that absolute physical and moral prostration that
    follows a sudden breaking off from the use of stimulating
    drinks.</p>

    <h3>LADIES' STAMPING POWDER.</h3>

    <p>For use in stamping any desired pattern upon goods for
    needle work, embroidery, etc. Draw pattern upon heavy paper,
    and perforate with small holes all the lines with some sharp
    instrument, dust the powder through, remove the pattern and
    pass a warm iron over the fabric, when the pattern will become
    fixed. Any desired color can be used, such as Prussian blue,
    chrome green, yellow, vermilion, etc. Fine white rosin, 2
    ounces; gum sandarach, 4 ounces; color, 2 ounces. Powder very
    fine, mix, and pass through a sieve.</p>

    <h3>INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT OUR BODIES.</h3>

    <p>The weight of the male infant at birth is 7 lbs.
    avoirdupois; that of the female is not quite 6-1/2 lbs. The
    maximum weight (140-1/2 lbs.) of the male is attained at the
    age of 40; that of the female (nearly 124 lbs.) is not attained
    until 50; from which ages they decline afterward, the male to
    127-1/4 lbs., the female to 100 lbs., nearly a stone. The
    full-grown adult is 20 times as heavy as a new-born infant. In
    the first year he triples his weight, afterwards the growth
    proceeds in geometrical progression, so that if 50 infants in
    their first year weigh 1,000 lbs., they will in the second
    weigh 1,210 lbs.; in the third 1,331: in the fourth 1464 lbs.;
    the term remaining very constant up to the ages of 11-12 in
    females, and 12-13 in males, where it must be nearly doubled;
    afterwards it may be continued, and will be found very nearly
    correct up to the age of 18 or 19, when the growth proceeds
    very slowly. At an equality of age the male is generally
    heavier than the female. Towards the age of 12 years only an
    individual of each sex has the same weight. The male attains
    the maximum weight at about the age of 40, and he begins to
    lose it very sensibly toward 60. At 80 he loses about 13.2328
    lbs., and the stature is diminished 2.756 inches. Females
    attain their maximum weight at about 50. The mean weight of a
    mature man is 104 lbs., and of an average woman 94 lbs. In old
    age they lose about 12 or 14 lbs. Men weigh most at 40, women
    at 50, and begin to lose weight at 60. The mean weight of both
    sexes in old age is that which they had at 19.</p>

    <p>When the male and female have assumed their complete
    development they weigh almost exactly 20 times as much as at
    birth, while the stature is about 3-1/2 times greater. Children
    lose weight during the first three days after birth; at the age
    of a week they sensibly increase; after one year they triple
    their weight; then they require six years to double their
    weight, and 13 to quadruple it.</p>

    <p>It has been computed that nearly two years' sickness is
    experienced by every person before he is 70 years old, and
    therefore that 10 days per annum is the average sickness of
    human life. Till 40 it is but half, and after 50 it rapidly
    increases. The mixed and fanciful diet of man is considered the
    cause of numerous diseases from which animals are exempt. Many
    diseases have abated with changes of diet, and others are
    virulent in particular countries, arising from
    peculiarities.</p>

    <p>Human Longevity.&mdash;Of 100,000 male and female children,
    in the first month they are reduced to 90,396, or nearly a
    tenth. In the second, to 87,936. In the third, to 86,175. In
    the fourth, to 84,720. In the fifth, to 83,571. In the sixth,
    to 82,526, and at the end of the first year to 77,528, the
    deaths being 2 to 9. The next four years reduce the 77,528 to
    62,448, indicating 37,552 deaths before the completion of the
    fifth year.</p>

    <p>At 25 years the 100,000 are half, or 49,995; at 52,
    one-third. At 58-1/2, a fourth, or 25,000; at 67, a fifth; at
    76, a tenth; at 81, a twentieth, or 5,000; and ten attain 100.
    Children die in large proportions because their diseases cannot
    be explained, and because the organs are not habituated to the
    functions of life. The mean of life varies in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"
       id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span> different countries from 40
       to 45. A generation from father to son is about 30 years; of
       men in general five-sixths die before 70, and
       fifteen-sixteenths before 80. After 80 it is rather
       endurance than enjoyment. The nerves are blunted, the senses
       fail, the muscles are rigid, the softer tubes become hard,
       the memory fails, the brain ossifies, the affections are
       buried, and hope ceases. The remaining one-sixteenth die at
       80; except a one-thirty-third, at 90. The remainder die from
       inability to live, at or before 100.</p>

    <p>About the age of 36 the lean man usually becomes fatter and
    the fat man leaner. Again, between the years of 43 and 50 his
    appetite fails, his complexion fades, and his tongue is apt to
    be furred on the least exertion of body or mind. At this period
    his muscles become flabby, his joints weak; his spirits droop,
    and his sleep is imperfect and unrefreshing. After suffering
    under these complaints a year, or perhaps two, he starts afresh
    with renewed vigor, and goes on to 61 or 62, when a similar
    change takes place, but with aggravated symptoms. When these
    grand periods have been successively passed, the gravity of
    incumbent years is more strongly marked, and he begins to boast
    of his age.</p>

    <p>In Russia, much more than in any other country, instances of
    longevity are numerous, if true. In the report of the Holy
    Synod, in 1827, during the year 1825, and only among the Greek
    religion, 848 men had reached upward of 100 years of age; 32
    had passed their 120th year, 4 from 130 to 135. Out of 606,818
    men who died in 1826, 2,765 were above 90; 1,432 above 95, and
    848 above 100 years of age. Among this last number 88 were
    above 115; 24 more than 120; 7 above 125, and one 130. Riley
    asserts that Arabs in the Desert live 200 years.</p>

    <p>On the average, men have their first-born at 30 and women at
    28. The greatest number of deliveries take place between 25 and
    35. The greatest number of deliveries take place in the winter
    months, and in February, and the smallest in July, <i>i.e.</i>,
    to February, as 4 to 5 in towns and 3 to 4 in the country. The
    night births are to the day as 5 to 4.</p>

    <p>Human Strength.&mdash;In Schulze's experiments on human
    strength, he found that men of five feet, weighing 126 lbs.,
    could lift vertically 156 lbs. 8 inches; 217 lbs. 1.2 inches.
    Others, 6.1 feet, weighing 183 lbs., 156 lbs. 13 inches, and
    217 lbs. 6 inches; others 6 feet 3 inches, weighing 158 lbs.,
    156 lbs. 16 inches, and 217 lbs. 9 inches. By a great variety
    of experiments he determined the mean human strength at 30
    lbs., with a velocity of 2.5 feet per second; or it is equal to
    the raising half a hogshead 10 feet in a minute.</p>

    <h3>RULES FOR SPELLING.</h3>

    <p>"Words ending in <i>e</i> drop that letter before the
    termination <i>able</i>, as in move, movable; unless ending in
    <i>ce</i> or <i>ge</i>, when it is retained, as in change,
    changeable, etc.</p>

    <p>Words of one syllable, ending in a consonant, with a single
    vowel before it, double the consonants in derivatives; as,
    ship, shipping, etc. But if ending in a consonant with a double
    vowel before it, they do not double the consonant in
    derivatives; as, troop, trooper, etc.</p>

    <p>Words of more than one syllable, ending in a consonant
    preceded by a single vowel, and accented on the last syllable,
    double that consonant in derivatives; as, commit, committed;
    but except chagrin, chagrined.</p>

    <p>All words of one syllable ending in <i>l</i>, with a single
    vowel before it, have <i>ll</i> at the close; as mill, sell.
    All words of one syllable ending in <i>l</i>, with a double
    vowel before it, have only one <i>l</i> at the close; as mail,
    sail.</p>

    <p>The words foretell, distill, instill and fulfill, retain the
    <i>ll</i> of their primitives. Derivatives of dull, skill, will
    and full also retain the <i>ll</i> when the accent falls on
    these words; as dullness, skillfull, willfull, fullness.</p>

    <p>Words of more than one syllable ending in <i>l</i> have only
    one <i>l</i> at the close; as delightful, faithful; unless the
    accent falls on the last syllable; as befall, etc.</p>

    <p>Words ending in <i>l</i>, double the letter in the
    termination <i>ly</i>.</p>

    <p>Participles ending in <i>ing</i>, from verbs ending in
    <i>e</i>, lose the final <i>e</i>; as have, having; make,
    making, etc; but verbs ending in <i>ee</i> retain both; as see,
    seeing. The word dye, to color, however, must retain the
    <i>e</i> before <i>ing</i>. All verbs ending in <i>ly</i>, and
    nouns ending in <i>ment</i>, retain the <i>e</i> final of the
    primitives; as brave, bravely; refine, refinement; except words
    ending in <i>dge</i>; as, acknowledge, acknowledgment.</p>

    <p>Nouns ending in <i>y</i>, preceded by a vowel, form their
    plural by adding <i>s</i>; as money, moneys; but if <i>y</i> is
    preceded by a consonant, it is changed to <i>ies</i> in the
    plural; as bounty, bounties.</p>

    <p>Compound words whose primitives end in <i>y</i>, change the
    <i>y</i> into <i>i</i>; as beauty, beautiful.</p>

    <h3>THE USE OF CAPITALS.</h3>

    <p>Every entire sentence should begin with a capital.</p>

    <p>Proper names, and adjectives derived from these, should
    begin with a capital.</p>

    <p>All appellations of the Deity should begin with a capital.
    Official and honorary titles should begin with a capital.</p>

    <p>Every line of poetry should begin with a capital.</p>

    <p>Titles of books and the heads of their chapters and
    divisions are printed in capitals.</p>

    <p>The pronoun I and the exclamation O are always capitals.</p>

    <p>The days of the week and the months of the year begin with
    capitals.</p>

    <p>Every quotation should begin with a capital letter.</p>

    <p>Names of religious denominations begin with capitals.</p>

    <p>In preparing accounts each item should begin with a
    capital.</p>

    <p>Any word of very special importance may begin with a
    capital.</p>

    <h3>RULES FOR THE PRESERVATION OF HEALTH.</h3>

    <p>Pure atmospheric air is composed of nitrogen, oxygen and a
    very small proportion of carbonic acid gas. Air once breathed
    has lost the chief part of its oxygen, and acquired a
    proportionate increase of carbonic acid gas. Therefore, health
    requires that we breathe the same air once only.</p>

    <p>The solid part of our bodies is continually wasting and
    requires to be repaired by fresh substances. Therefore, food,
    which is to repair the loss, should be taken with due regard to
    the exercise and waste of the body.</p>

    <p>The fluid part of our bodies also wastes constantly; there
    is but one fluid in animals, which is water. Therefore, water
    only is necessary, and no artifice can produce a better
    drink.</p>

    <p>The fluid of our bodies is to the solid in proportion as
    nine to one. Therefore, a like proportion should prevail in the
    total amount of food taken.</p>

    <p>Light exercises an important influence upon the growth and
    vigor of animals and plants. Therefore, our dwellings should
    freely admit the sun's rays.</p>

    <p>Decomposing animal and vegetable substances yield various
    noxious gases, which enter the lungs and corrupt the blood.
    Therefore, all impurities should be kept away from our abodes,
    and every precaution be observed to secure a pure
    atmosphere.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"
       id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span>

    <p>Warmth is essential to all the bodily functions. Therefore,
    an equal bodily temperature should be maintained by exercise,
    by clothing or by fire.</p>

    <p>Exercise warms, invigorates and purifies the body; clothing
    preserves the warmth the body generates; fire imparts warmth
    externally. Therefore, to obtain and preserve warmth, exercise
    and clothing are preferable to fire.</p>

    <p>Fire consumes the oxygen of the air, and produces noxious
    gases. Therefore, the air is less pure in the presence of
    candles, gas or coal fire, than otherwise, and the
    deterioration should be repaired by increased ventilation. The
    skin is a highly-organized membrane, full of minute pores,
    cells, blood-vessels, and nerves; it imbibes moisture or throws
    it off according to the state of the atmosphere or the
    temperature of the body. It also "breathes," like the lungs
    (though less actively). All the internal organs sympathize with
    the skin. Therefore, it should be repeatedly cleansed.</p>

    <p>Late hours and anxious pursuits exhaust the nervous system
    and produce disease and premature death. Therefore, the hours
    of labor and study should be short.</p>

    <p>Mental and bodily exercise are equally essential to the
    general health and happiness. Therefore, labor and study should
    succeed each other.</p>

    <p>Man will live most happily upon simple solids and fluids, of
    which a sufficient but temperate quantity should be taken.
    Therefore, over-indulgence in strong drinks, tobacco, snuff,
    opium, and all mere indulgences, should be avoided.</p>

    <p>Sudden alternations of heat and cold are dangerous
    (especially to the young and the aged). Therefore, clothing, in
    quantity and quality, should be adapted to the alternations of
    night and day, and of the seasons. And therefore, also,
    drinking cold water when the body is hot, and hot tea and soups
    when cold are productive of many evils.</p>

    <p>Never visit a sick person (especially if the complaint be of
    a contagious nature) with an empty stomach, as this disposes
    the system more readily to receive the contagion. And in
    attending a sick person, place yourself where the air passes
    from the door or window to the bed of the diseased; not between
    the diseased person and any fire that is in the room, as the
    heat of the fire will draw the infectious vapor in that
    direction.</p>

    <p><b>CAPTAIN KIDD</b>, a notorious American pirate, was born
    about 1650. In 1696 he was entrusted by the British Government
    with the command of a privateer, and sailed from New York, for
    the purpose of suppressing the numerous pirates then infesting
    the seas. He went to the East Indies, where he began a career
    of piracy, and returned to New York in 1698 with a large amount
    of booty. He was soon after arrested, sent to England for
    trial, and executed in 1701.</p>

    <p><b>LEANING TOWER OF PISA.</b>&mdash;The leaning tower of
    Pisa was commenced in 1152, and was not finished till the
    fourteenth century. The cathedral to which this belongs was
    erected to celebrate a triumph of the Pisans in the harbor of
    Palermo in 1063, when allied with the Normans to drive the
    Saracens out of Sicily. It is a circular building, one hundred
    feet in diameter and 179 feet in extreme height, and has fine
    mosaic pavements, elaborately carved columns, and numerous
    bas-reliefs. The building is of white marble. The tower is
    divided into eight stories, each having an outside gallery of
    seven feet projection, and the topmost story overhangs the base
    about sixteen feet, though, as the center of gravity is still
    ten feet within the base, the building is perfectly safe. It
    has been supposed that this inclination was intentional, but
    the opinion that the foundation has sunk is no doubt correct.
    It is most likely that the defective foundation became
    perceptible before the tower had reached one-half its height,
    as at that elevation the unequal length of the columns exhibits
    an endeavor to restore the perpendicular, and at about the same
    place the walls are strengthened with iron bars.</p>

    <p>What causes the water to flow out of an artesian
    well?&mdash;The theoretical explanation of the phenomenon is
    easily understood. The secondary and tertiary geological
    formations often present the appearance of immense basins, the
    boundary or rim of the basin having been formed by an upheaval
    of adjacent strata. In these formations it often happens that a
    porous stratum, consisting of sand, sandstone, chalk or other
    calcareous matter, is included between two impermeable layers
    of clay, so as to form a flat <ins class="correction"
    title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'porus'.">
    porous</ins> U tube, continuous from side to side of the valley,
    the outcrop on the surrounding hills forming the mouth of the
     tube. The rain filtering down through the porous layer to
     the bottom of the basin forms there a subterranean pool,
     which, with the liquid or semi-liquid column pressing upon
     it, constitutes a sort of huge natural hydrostatic
     bellows. Sometimes the pressure on the superincumbent
     crust is so great as to cause an upheaval or disturbance
     of the valley. It is obvious, then, that when a hole is
     bored down through the upper impermeable layer to the
     surface of the lake, the water will be forced up by the
     natural law of water seeking its level to a height above
     the surface of the valley, greater or less, according to
     the elevation of the level in the feeding column, thus
     forming a natural mountain on precisely the same principle
     as that of most artificial fountains, where the water
     supply comes from a considerable height above the jet.</p>

    <p><b>HOW MANY CUBIC FEET THERE ARE IN A TON OF
    COAL.</b>&mdash;There is a difference between a ton of hard
    coal and one of soft coal. For that matter, coal from different
    mines, whether hard or soft, differs in weight, and
    consequently in cubic measure, according to quality. Then there
    is a difference according to size. To illustrate, careful
    measurements have been made of Wilkes-barre anthracite, a fine
    quality of hard coal, with the following results:</p>

    <p>For soft coal the following measures may be taken as nearly
    correct; it is simply impossible to determine any exact rule,
    even for bituminous coal of the same district: Briar Hill coal,
    44.8 cubic feet per ton of 2,240 pounds; Pittsburgh, 47.8;
    Wilmington, Ill., 47; Indiana block coal, 42 to 43 cubic
    feet.</p>

    <p>The dimensions of the great wall of China and of what it is
    built.&mdash;It runs from a point on the Gulf of Liantung, an
    arm of the Gulf of Pechili in Northeastern China, westerly to
    the Yellow River; thence makes a great bend to the south for
    nearly 100 miles, and then runs to the northwest for several
    hundred miles to the Desert of Gobi. Its length is variously
    estimated to be from 1,250 to 1,500 miles. For the most of this
    distance it runs through a mountainous country, keeping on the
    ridges, and winding over many of the highest peaks. In some
    places it is only a formidable rampart, but most of the way it
    is composed of lofty walls of masonry and concrete, or impacted
    lime and clay, from 12 to 16 feet in thickness, and from 15 to
    30 or 35 feet in height. The top of this wall is paved for
    hundreds of miles, and crowned with crenallated battlements,
    and towers 30 to 40 feet high. In numerous places the wall
    climbs such steep declivities that its top ascends from height
    to height in flights of granite steps. An army could march on
    the top of the wall for weeks and even months, moving in some
    places ten men abreast.</p>

    <p>Limits of Natural Vision.&mdash;This question is too
    indefinite for a specific answer. The limits of vision vary
    with elevation, conditions of the atmosphere, intensity of
    illumination, and other modifying elements in different cases.
    In a clear day an object one foot above a level plain may be
    seen at the distance of 1.31 miles; one ten feet high, 4.15
    miles; one twenty feet high, 5.86 miles; one 100 feet high,
    13.1 miles; one a mile high, as the top of a mountain, 95.23
    miles. This allows seven inches (or, to be exact, 6.99 inches)
    for the curvature of the earth, and assumes that the size and
    illumination of the object are sufficient to produce an image.
    Five miles may be taken as the extreme limit at which a man is
    visible on a flat plain to an observer on the same level.</p>

    <p><b>THE NIAGARA SUSPENSION BRIDGE.</b>&mdash;For seven miles
    below the falls, Niagara river flows through a gorge varying in
    width from 200 to 400 yards. Two miles below the falls the
    river is but 350 feet wide, and it is here that the great
    suspension bridge, constructed in 1855 by Mr. Roebling, crosses
    the gorge, 245 feet above the water. The length of the span,
    from tower to tower, is 821 feet, and the total length of the
    bridge is 2,220 feet. The length of the span, which is capable
    of sustaining a strain of 10,000 tons, is 821 feet from tower
    to tower, and the total length of the bridge is 2,220 feet. It
    is used both for railway and wagon traffic, the wagon-road and
    foot-way being directly under the railway bed. There is another
    suspension bridge across the Niagara river at a distance of
    only about fifty rods from the falls, on the American side.
    This is only for carriages and foot travel. It was finished in
    1869. It is 1,190 feet long from cliff to cliff, 1,268 feet
    from tower to tower, and 190 feet above the river, which at
    this point is a little over 900 feet in width.</p>

    <p><b>THE SPEED OF SOUND.</b>&mdash;It has been ascertained
    that a full human voice, speaking in the open air, calm, can be
    heard at a distance of 400 feet; in an observable breeze a
    powerful human voice with the wind is audible at a distance of
    15,840 feet; the report of a musket, 16,000 feet; a drum,
    10,560 feet; music, a strong brass band, 15,840 feet; very
    heavy cannonading, 575,000 feet, or 90 miles. In the Arctic
    regions conversation has been maintained over water a distance
    of 6,766 feet. In gases the velocity of sound increases with
    the temperature; in air this increase is about two feet per
    second for each degree centigrade. The velocity of sound in
    oxygen gas at zero C. is 1,040 feet; in carbonic acid, 858
    feet; in hydrogen, 4,164 feet. In 1827 Colladon and Sturm
    determined experimentally the velocity of sound in fresh water;
    the experiment was made in the Lake of Geneva, and it was found
    to be 4,174 feet per second at a temperature of 15 degrees C.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"
       id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span> The velocity of sound in
       alcohol at 20 degrees C. is 4,218 feet; in ether at zero,
       3,801; in sea water at 20 degrees C., 4,768. By direct
       measurements, carefully made, by observing at night the
       interval which elapses between the flash and report of a
       cannon at a known distance, the velocity of sound has been
       about 1,090 per second at the temperature of freezing
       water.</p>

    <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE YELLOWSTONE PARK.</b>&mdash;The
    Yellowstone National Park extends sixty-five miles north and
    south, and fifty-five miles east and west, comprising 3,575
    square miles, and is all 6,000 feet or more above sea-level.
    Yellowstone Lake, twenty miles by fifteen, has an altitude of
    7,788 feet. The mountain ranges which hem in the valleys on
    every side rise to the height of 10,000 to 12,000 feet, and are
    always covered with snow. This great park contains the most
    striking of all the mountains, gorges, falls, rivers and lakes
    in the whole Yellowstone region. The springs on Gardiner's
    River cover an area of about one square mile, and three or four
    square miles thereabout are occupied by the remains of springs
    which have ceased to flow. The natural basins into which these
    springs flow are from four to six feet in diameter and from one
    to four feet in depth. The principal ones are located upon
    terraces midway up the sides of the mountain. The banks of the
    Yellowstone River abound with ravines and canons, which are
    carved out of the heart of the mountains through the hardest of
    rocks. The most remarkable of these is the canon of Tower Creek
    and Column Mountain. The latter, which extends along the
    eastern bank of the river for upward of two miles, is said to
    resemble the Giant's Causeway. The canon of Tower Creek is
    about ten miles in length and is so deep and gloomy that it is
    called "The Devil's Den." Where Tower Creek ends the Grand
    Canon begins. It is twenty miles in length, impassable
    throughout, and inaccessible at the water's edge, except at a
    few points. Its rugged edges are from 200 to 500 yards apart,
    and its depth is so profound that no sound ever reaches the ear
    from the bottom. The Grand Canon contains a great multitude of
    hot springs of sulphur, sulphate of copper, alum, etc. In the
    number and magnitude of its hot springs and geysers, the
    Yellowstone Park surpasses all the rest of the world. There are
    probably fifty geysers that throw a column of water to the
    height of from 50 to 200 feet, and it is stated that there are
    not fewer than 5,000 springs; there are two kinds, those
    depositing lime and those depositing silica. The temperature of
    the calcareous springs is from 160 to 170 degrees, while that
    of the others rises to 200 or more. The principal collections
    are the upper and lower geyser basins of the Madison River, and
    the calcareous springs on Gardiner's River. The great falls are
    marvels to which adventurous travelers have gone only to return
    and report that they are parts of the wonders of this new
    American wonderland.</p>

    <p><b>DESIGNATIONS OF GROUPS OF ANIMALS.</b>&mdash;The
    ingenuity of the sportsman is, perhaps, no better illustrated
    than by the use he puts the English language to in designating
    particular groups of animals. The following is a list of the
    terms which have been applied to the various classes:</p>

    <p>A covey of patridges, A nide of pheasants, A wisp of snipe,
    A flight of doves or swallows, A muster of peacocks, A siege of
    herons, A building of rooks, A brood of grouse, A plump of wild
    fowl, A stand of plovers, A watch of nightingales, A clattering
    of choughs, A flock of geese, A herd or bunch of cattle, A bevy
    of quails, A cast of hawks, A trip of dottrell, A swarm of
    bees, A school of whales, A shoal of herrings, A herd of swine,
    A skulk of foxes, A pack of wolves, A drove of oxen, A sounder
    of hogs, A troop of monkeys, A pride of lions, A sleuth of
    bears, A gang of elk.</p>

    <p><b>THE BUNKER HILL MONUMENT.</b>&mdash;The monument is a
    square shaft, built of Quincy granite, 221 feet high, 31 feet
    square at the base and 15 at the top. Its foundations are
    inclosed 12 feet under ground. Inside the shaft is a round,
    hollow cone, 7 feet wide at the bottom and 4 feet 2 inches at
    the top, encircled by a winding staircase of 224 stone steps,
    which leads to a chamber immediately under the apex, 11 feet in
    diameter. The chamber has four windows, which afford a wide
    view of the surrounding country, and contains two cannons,
    named respectively Hancock and Adams, which were used in many
    engagements during the war. The corner-stone of the monument
    was laid on the fiftieth anniversary of the battle, June 17,
    1825, by Lafayette, who was then visiting America, when Webster
    pronounced the oration. The monument was completed, and June
    17, 1843, was dedicated, Webster again delivering the
    oration.</p>

    <p><b>THE SEVEN WISE MEN OF GREECE.</b>&mdash;The names
    generally given are Solon, Chilo, Pittacus, Bias, Periander (in
    place of whom some give Epimenides), Cleobulus, and Thales.
    They were the authors of the celebrated mottoes inscribed in
    later days in the Delphian Temple. These mottoes were as
    follows:</p>

    <p class="i6">"Know thyself."&mdash;Solon.</p>

    <p class="i6">"Consider the end."&mdash;Chilo.</p>

    <p class="i6">"Know thy opportunity."&mdash;Pittacus.</p>

    <p class="i6">"Most men are bad."&mdash;Bias.</p>

    <p class="i6">"Nothing is impossible to
    industry."&mdash;Periander.</p>

    <p class="i6">"Avoid excesses."&mdash;Cleobulus.</p>

    <p class="i6">"Suretyship is the precursor of
    ruin."&mdash;Thales.</p>

    <p><b>FIRST STEAMBOAT ON THE MISSISSIPPI.</b>&mdash;Nicholas J.
    Roosevelt was the first to take a steamboat down the great
    river. His boat was built at Pittsburgh, in the year 1811,
    under an arrangement with Fulton and Livingston, from Fulton's
    plans. It was called the "New Orleans," was about 200 tons
    burden, and was propelled by a stern-wheel, assisted, when the
    wind was favorable, by sails carried on two masts. The hull was
    138 feet long, 30 feet beam, and the cost of the whole,
    including engines, was about $40,000. The builder, with his
    family, an engineer, a pilot, and six "deck hands," left
    Pittsburgh in October, 1811, reaching Louisville in about
    seventy hours (steaming about ten miles an hour), and New
    Orleans in fourteen days, steaming from Natchez.</p>

    <p><b>THE EXPLORATIONS OF FREMONT.</b>&mdash;- Among the
    earliest efforts of Fremont, after he had tried and been
    sickened by the sea, were his experiences as a surveyor and
    engineer on railroad lines from Charleston to Augusta, Ga., and
    Charleston to Cincinnati. Then he accompanied an army
    detachment on a military reconnoissance of the mountainous
    Cherokee country in Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee, made
    in the depth of winter. In 1838-9 he accompanied M. Nicollet in
    explorations of the country between the Missouri and the
    British line, and his first detail of any importance, after he
    had been commissioned by President Van Buren, was to make an
    examination of the river Des Moines, then on the Western
    frontier. In 1841 he projected his first trans-continental
    expedition, and left Washington May 2, 1842, and accomplished
    the object of his trip, examined the South Pass, explored the
    Wind River mountains, ascended in August, the highest peak of
    that range, now known as Fremont's Peak, and returned, after an
    absence of four months. His report of the expedition attracted
    great attention in the United States and abroad. Fremont began
    to plan another and a second expedition. He determined to
    extend his explorations across the continent; and in May, 1843,
    commenced his journey with thirty-nine men, and September 6,
    after traveling over 1,700 miles, arrived at the Great Salt
    Lake; there made some important discoveries, and then pushed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"
       id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span> the upper Columbia, down
       whose valley he proceeded to Fort Vancouver, near its mouth.
       On Nov. 10, he set out to return East, selecting a
       southeasterly course, leading from the lower part of the
       Columbia to the upper Colorado, through an almost unknown
       region, crossed by high and rugged mountains. He and his
       party suffered incredible hardships in crossing from the
       Great Basin to Sutter's Fort on the Sacramento; started from
       there March 24, proceeded southward, skirted the western
       base of the Sierra Nevada, crossed that range through a gap,
       entered the Great Basin; again visited the Great Salt Lake,
       from which they returned through the South Pass to Kansas,
       in July, 1844, after an absence of fourteen months. In the
       spring of 1845 Fremont set out on a third expedition to
       explore the Great Basin and the maritime region of Oregon
       and California; spent the summer examining the headwaters of
       the rivers whose springs are in the grand divide of the
       continent; in October camped on the shores of the Great Salt
       Lake: proceeded to explore the Sierra Nevada, which he again
       crossed in the dead of winter; made his way into the Valley
       of the San Joaquin; obtained permission, at Monterey, from
       the Mexican authorities there, to proceed with his
       expedition, which permission was almost immediately revoked,
       and Fremont peremptorily ordered to leave the country
       without delay, but he refused, and a collision was imminent,
       but was averted, and Fremont proceeded toward San Joaquin.
       Near Tlamath Lake, Fremont met, May 9, 1846, a party in
       search of him, with dispatches from Washington, ordering him
       to watch over the interests of the United States in
       California, as there was reason to believe that province
       would be transferred to Great Britain. He at once returned
       to California; General Castro was already marching against
       our settlements; the settlers rose in arms, flocked to
       Fremont's camp, and, with him as leader, in less than a
       month, all Northern California was freed from Mexican
       authority; and on July 4 Fremont was elected Governor of
       California by the American settlers. Later came the conflict
       between Commodore Stockton and General Kearney; and Fremont
       resigned his commission as Lieutenant-Colonel, to which he
       had been promoted. In October, 1848, he started across the
       continent on a fourth expedition, outfitted at his own
       expense, to find a practicable route to California. In
       attempting to cross the great Sierra, covered with snow, his
       guide lost his way, and the party encountered horrible
       suffering from cold and hunger, a portion of them being
       driven to cannibalism; he lost all his animals (he had 120
       mules when he started), and one-third of his men (he had
       thirty-three) perished, and he had to retrace his steps to
       Santa Fe. He again set out, with thirty men, and, after a
       long search, discovered a secure route, which led to the
       Sacramento, where he arrived in the spring of 1840. He led a
       fifth expedition across the continent in 1853, at his own
       expense, and found passes through the mountains in the line
       of latitude 38 deg., 39 min., and reached California after
       enduring great hardships; for fifty days his party lived on
       horse-flesh, and for forty-eight hours at a time without
       food of any kind. These are the barest outlines of five
       expeditions of which many volumes have been written, but
       will hint at Fremont's work in the West which entitled him
       to the name of the "Pathfinder."</p>

    <p><b>CHINESE PROVERBS.</b>&mdash;The Chinese are indeed
    remarkably fond of proverbs. They not only employ them in
    conversation&mdash;and even to a greater degree than the
    Spaniards, who are noted among Europeans for the number and
    excellence of their proverbial sayings&mdash;but they have a
    practice of adorning their reception rooms with these
    sententious bits of wisdom, inscribed on decorated scrolls or
    embroidered on rich crapes and brocades. They carve them on
    door-posts and pillars, and emblazon them on the walls and
    ceilings in gilt letters. The following are a few specimens of
    this sort of literature: As a sneer at the use of unnecessary
    force to crush a contemptible enemy, they say: "He rides a
    fierce dog to catch a lame rabbit." Similar to this is another,
    "To use a battle-ax to cut off a hen's head." They say of
    wicked associates: "To cherish a bad man is like nourishing a
    tiger; if not well-fed he will devour you." Here are several
    others mingling wit with wisdom: "To instigate a villain to do
    wrong is like teaching a monkey to climb trees;" "To catch fish
    and throw away the net," which recalls our saying, "Using the
    cat's paw to pull the chestnuts out of the fire;" "To climb a
    tree to catch a fish" is to talk much to no purpose; "A
    superficial scholar is a sheep dressed in a tiger's skin;" "A
    cuckoo in a magpie's nest," equivalent to saying, "he is
    enjoying another's labor without compensation;" "If the blind
    lead the blind they will both fall into the pit;" "A fair wind
    raises no storm;" "Vast chasms can be filled, but the heart of
    man is never satisfied;" "The body may be healed, but the mind
    is incurable;" "He seeks the ass, and lo! he sits upon him;"
    "He who looks at the sun is dazzled; he who hears the thunder
    is deafened." i. e., do not come too near the powerful;
    "Prevention is better than cure;" "Wine and good dinners make
    abundance of friends, but in adversity not one of them is to be
    found." "Let every man sweep the snow from before his own door,
    and not trouble himself about the frost on his neighbor's
    tiles." The following one is a gem of moral wisdom: "Only
    correct yourself on the same principle that you correct others,
    and excuse others on the same principles on which you excuse
    yourself." "Better not be, than be nothing." "One thread does
    not make a rope; one swallow does not make a summer."
    "Sensuality is the chief of sins, filial duty the best of
    acts." "The horse's back is not so safe us the
    buffalo's"&mdash;the former is used by the politician, the
    latter by the farmer. "Too much lenity multiplies crime." "If
    you love your son give him plenty of the rod; if you hate him
    cram him with dainties." "He is my teacher who tells me my
    faults, he my enemy who speaks my virtues." Having a wholesome
    dread of litigation, they say of one who goes to law, "He sues
    a flea to catch a bite." Their equivalent for our "coming out
    at the little end of the horn" is, "The farther the rat creeps
    up (or into) the cow's horn, the narrower it grows." The truth
    of their saying that "The fame of good deeds does not leave a
    man's door, but his evil acts are known a thousand miles off,"
    is illustrated in our own daily papers every morning. Finally,
    we close this list with a Chinese proverb which should be
    inscribed on the lintel of every door in Christendom: "The
    happy-hearted man carries joy for all the household."</p>

    <p><b>MASON AND DIXON'S LINE.</b>&mdash;Mason and Dixon's line
    is the concurrent State line of Maryland and Pennsylvania. It
    is named after two eminent astronomers and <ins class="correction"
    title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'mathemeticians'.">
    mathematicians</ins>,
    Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, who were sent out from
    England to run it. They completed the survey between 1703 and
    1707, excepting thirty-six miles surveyed in 1782 by Colonel
    Alex. McLean and Joseph Neville. It is in the latitude of 39
    deg. 43 min. 26.3 sec.</p>

    <p><b>GREAT FIRES OF HISTORY.</b>&mdash;The loss of life and
    property in the willful destruction by fire and sword of the
    principal cities of ancient history&mdash;Nineveh, Babylon,
    Persepolis, Carthage, Palmyra, and many others&mdash;is largely
    a matter of conjecture. The following is a memorandum of the
    chief conflagrations of the current era:</p>

    <p>In 64, A. D., during the reign of Nero, a terrible fire
    raged in Rome for eight days, destroying ten of the fourteen
    wards. The loss of life and destruction of property is not
    known.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"
    id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span>

    <p>A. D., Jerusalem was taken by the Romans and a large part of
    it given to the torch, entailing an enormous destruction of
    life and property.</p>

    <p>In 1106 Venice, then a city of immense opulence, was almost,
    wholly consumed by a fire, originating in accident or
    incendiarism.</p>

    <p>In 1212 the greater part of London was burned.</p>

    <p>In 1606 what is known as the Great Fire of London raged in
    the city from September 2 to 6, consuming 13,200 houses, with
    St. Paul's Church, 86 parish churches, 6 chapels, the Guild
    Hall, the Royal Exchange, the Custom House, 52 companies halls,
    many hospitals, libraries and other public edifices. The total
    destruction of property was estimated at $53,652,500. Six lives
    were lost, and 436 acres burnt over.</p>

    <p>In 1679 a fire in Boston burned all the warehouses, eighty
    dwellings, and vessels in the dock-yards; loss estimated at
    $1,000,000.</p>

    <p>In 1700 a large part of Edinburgh was burned; loss unknown.
    In 1728 Copenhagen was nearly destroyed; 1,650 houses
    burned.</p>

    <p>In 1736 a fire in St. Petersburg burned 2,000 houses.</p>

    <p>In 1729 a fire in Constantinople destroyed 12,000 houses,
    and 7,000 people perished. The same city suffered a
    conflagration in 1745, lasting five days; and in 1750 a series
    of three appalling fires: one in January, consuming 10,000
    houses; another in April destroying property to the value of
    $5,000,000, according to one historian, and according to
    another, $15,000,000; and in the latter part of the year
    another, sweeping fully 10,000 houses more out of existence. It
    seemed as if Constantinople was doomed to utter
    annihilation.</p>

    <p>In 1751 a fire in Stockholm destroyed 1,000 houses and
    another fire in the same city in 1759 burned 250 houses with a
    loss of $2,420,000.</p>

    <p>In 1752 a fire in Moscow swept away 18,000 houses, involving
    an immense loss.</p>

    <p>In 1758 Christiania suffered a loss of $1,250,000 by
    conflagration. In 1760 the Portsmouth (England) dock yards were
    burned, with a loss of $2,000,000.</p>

    <p>In 1764 a fire in Konigsburg, Prussia, consumed the public
    buildings, with a loss of $3,000,000; and in 1769 the city was
    almost totally destroyed.</p>

    <p>In 1763 a fire in Smyrna destroyed 2,600 houses, with a loss
    of $1,000,000; in 1772 a fire in the same city carried off
    3,000 dwellings and 3,000 to 4,000 shops, entailing a loss of
    $20,000,000; and in 1796 there were 4,000 shops, mosques,
    magazines, etc., burned.</p>

    <p>In 1776, six days after the British seized the city, a fire
    swept off all the west side of New York city, from Broadway to
    the river.</p>

    <p>In 1771 a fire in Constantinople burned 2,500 houses;
    another in 1778 burned 2,000 houses; in 1782 there were 600
    houses burned in February, 7,000 in June, and on August 12
    during a conflagration that lasted three days, 10,000 houses,
    50 mosques, and 100 corn-mills, with a loss of 100 lives. Two
    years later a fire, on March 13, destroyed two-thirds of Pera,
    the loveliest suburb of Constantinople, and on August 5 a fire
    in the main city, lasting twenty-six hours, burned 10,000
    houses. In this same fire-scourged city, in 1791, between March
    and July, there were 32,000 houses burned, and about as many
    more in 1795; and in 1799 Pera was again swept with fire, with
    a loss of 13,000 houses, including many buildings of great
    magnificence.</p>

    <p>In 1784 a fire and explosion in the dock yards, Brest,
    caused a loss of $5,000,000.</p>

    <p>But the greatest destruction of life and property by
    conflagration, of which the world has anything like accurate
    records, must be looked for within the current century. Of
    these the following is a partial list of instances in which the
    loss of property amounted to $3,000,000 and upward:</p>

    <p>Taking into account, with the fires of Paris and Chicago,
    the great Wisconsin and Michigan forest fires of 1871, in which
    it is estimated that 1,000 human beings perished and property
    to the amount of over $3,000,000 was consumed, it is plain that
    in the annals of conflagrations that year stands forth in
    gloomy pre-eminence.</p>

    <p><b>TABLE FOR MEASURING AN ACRE.</b>&mdash;To measure an acre
    in rectangular form is a simple question in arithmetic. One has
    only to divide the total number of square yards in an acre,
    4,840, by the number of yards in the known side or breadth to
    find the unknown side in yards. By this process it appears that
    a rectangular strip of ground&mdash;</p>

    <p class="i6">&nbsp;&nbsp;5 yards wide by 968 yards long is 1
    acre.<br />
    10 yards wide by 484 yards long is 1 acre.<br />

    <p><b>GREAT SALT LAKE AND THE DEAD SEA.</b>&mdash;Great Salt
    Lake is a shallow body of water, its average depth being but a
    little more than three feet, while in many parts it is much
    less. The water is transparent, but excessively salt; it
    contains about 22 per cent of common salt, slightly mixed with
    other salts, and forming one of the purest and most
    concentrated brines in the world. Its specific gravity is 1.17.
    The water is so buoyant that a man may float in it at full
    length upon his back, having his head and neck, his legs to the
    knee, and both arms to the elbow, entirely out of water. If he
    assumes a sitting posture, with his arms extended, his
    shoulders will rise above the water. Swimming, however, is
    difficult as the lower limbs tend to rise above the surface,
    and the brine is so strong that to swallow even a very little
    of it will cause strangulation. The waters of the Dead Sea, on
    the other hand, are nearly black, and contain much sulphur and
    bitumen, as well as salt. It is also very deep, varying from
    thirteen feet near the south end of the lake to more than 1,300
    feet in the northern part. Its buoyancy is quite equal to that
    of Great Salt Lake, for travelers say that a man can float
    prone upon the surface for hours without danger of sinking, and
    in a sitting position is held breast-high above the water.</p>

    <p><b>SOME FAMOUS WAR SONGS.</b>&mdash;The slavery war
    developed several Union song-writers whose stirring verses have
    kept on singing themselves since the close of that great
    struggle. Two among them are best remembered nowadays, both men
    who wrote the words and composed the music to their own verses.
    Chicago lays claim to one, Dr. George F. Root, and Boston to
    the other, Henry C. Work. The song "Marching Through Georgia,"
    as every one knows, was written in memory of Sherman's famous
    march from Atlanta to the sea, and words and music were the
    composition of Henry C. Work, who died not many months ago (in
    1884). The first stanza is as follows:</p>

    <p class="i6">Bring the good old bugle, boys, we'll sing
    another song&mdash;<br />
    Sing it with spirit that will start the world
    along&mdash;<br />
    Sing it as we used to sing it, fifty thousand strong,<br />
    While we were marching through Georgia.</p>

    <p>Chorus&mdash;</p>

    <p class="i6">"Hurrah! hurrah! we bring the jubilee!<br />
    Hurrah! hurrah! the flag that makes you free!"<br />
    So we sang the chorus from Atlanta to the sea,<br />
    While we were marching through Georgia.</p>

    <p>Among the other songs of Work the following are best known:
    "Kingdom Coming," or "Say, Darkey, Hab You Seen de Massa?"
    "Babylon is Fallen," "Grafted into
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"
       id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span> Army" and "Corporal
       Schnapps." This record would be incomplete were we to fail
       to mention some of the many ringing songs of George F. Root,
       songs which have made the name of Root famous in thousands
       upon thousands of households in the West. Some of these
       songs are: "Battle Cry of Freedom," "Tramp, Tramp, Tramp,"
       "On, on, on, the Boys Came Marching," "Just Before the
       Battle, Mother," "Just After the Battle," "Lay Me Down and
       Save the Flag," "Stand Up for Uncle Sam, My Boys." The well
       known song, "Wrap the Flag Around Me, Boys," was composed by
       R. Stewart Taylor, and "When Johnny Cones Marching Home" by
       Louis Lambert.</p>

    <p>The figures as to the length of the Nile are estimated. The
    Amazon, with its tributaries (including the Rio Negro and
    Madeira), drains an area of 2,330,000 square miles; the
    Mississippi and Missouri, 1,726,000 square miles; the Yeneisy
    (or Yenisei, as it is often written) drains about 1,000,000
    square miles; the Volga, about 500,000. In this group of great
    rivers the St. Lawrence is the most remarkable. It constitutes
    by far the largest body of fresh water in the world. Including
    the lakes and streams, which it comprises in its widest
    acceptation, the St. Lawrence covers about 73,000 square miles;
    the aggregate, it is estimated, represents not less than 9,000
    solid miles&mdash;a mass of water which would have taken upward
    of forty years to pour over Niagara at the computed rate of
    1,000,000 cubic feet in a second. As the entire basin of this
    water system falls short of 300,000 square miles, the surface
    of the land is only three times that of the water.</p>

    <p><b>HOW THE UNITED STATES GOT ITS LANDS.</b>&mdash;The United
    States bought Louisiana, the vast region between the
    Mississippi River, the eastern and northern boundary of Texas
    (then belonging to Spain), and the dividing ridge of the Rocky
    Mountains, together with what is now Oregon, Washington
    Territory, and the western parts of Montana and Idaho, from
    France for $11,250,000. This was in 1803. Before the principal,
    interest, and claims of one sort and another assumed by the
    United States were settled, the total cost of this "Louisiana
    purchase," comprising, according to French construction and our
    understanding, 1,171,931 square miles, swelled to $23,500,000,
    or almost $25 per section&mdash;a fact not stated in
    cyclopedias and school histories, and therefore not generally
    understood. Spain still held Florida and claimed a part of what
    we understood to be included in the Louisiana purchase&mdash;a
    strip up to north latitude 31&mdash;and disputed our boundary
    along the south and west, and even claimed Oregon. We bought
    Florida and all the disputed land east of the Mississippi and
    her claim to Oregon, and settled our southwestern boundary
    dispute for the sum of $6,500,000. Texas smilingly proposed
    annexation to the United States, and this great government was
    "taken in" December 29, 1845, Texas keeping her public lands
    and giving us all her State debts and a three-year war (costing
    us $66,000,000) with Mexico, who claimed her for a runaway from
    Mexican jurisdiction. This was a bargain that out-yankeed the
    Yankees, but the South insisted on it and the North submitted.
    After conquering all the territory now embraced in New Mexico,
    a part of Colorado, Arizona, Utah, Nevada and California, we
    paid Mexico $25,000,000 for it&mdash;$15,000,000 for the
    greater part of it and $10,000,000 for another slice, known as
    the "Gadsden purchase." In 1867 we bought Alaska from Russia
    for $7,200,000. All the several amounts above named were paid
    long ago. As for all the rest of our landed possessions, we
    took them with us when we cut loose from mother Britain's apron
    string, but did not get a clear title until we had fought ten
    years for it&mdash;first in the Revolutionary War, costing us
    in killed 7,343 reported&mdash;besides the unreported
    killed&mdash;and over 15,000 wounded, and $135,193,103 in
    money; afterward in the War of 1812-15, costing us in killed
    1,877, in wounded 3,737, in money $107,159,003. We have paid
    everybody but the Indians, the only real owners, and, thanks to
    gunpowder, sword, bayonet, bad whisky, small-pox, cholera and
    other weapons of civilization, there are not many of them left
    to complain. Besides all the beads, earrings, blankets, pots,
    kettles, brass buttons, etc., given them for land titles in the
    olden times, we paid them, or the Indian agents, in one way and
    another, in the ninety years from 1791 to 1881, inclusive,
    $193,672,697.31, to say nothing of the thousands of lives
    sacrificed and many millions spent in Indian wars, from the war
    of King Philip to the last fight with the Apaches.</p>

    <p><b>ILLUSTRIOUS MEN AND WOMEN.</b>&mdash;It is not likely
    that any two persons would agree as to who are entitled to the
    first fifty places on the roll of great men and great women.
    Using "great" in the sense of eminence in their professions, of
    great military commanders the following are among the chief:
    Sesostris, the Egyptian conqueror, who is represented as having
    subdued all Asia to the Oxus and the Ganges, Ethiopia, and a
    part of Europe; Cyrus the Great; Alexander the Great; Hannibal;
    Che-Hwanti, who reduced all the kingdoms of China and
    Indo-China to one empire, and constructed the Great Wall;
    C&aelig;sar; Genghis Khan, the Tartar chief, who overran all
    Asia and a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"
       id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span> part of Europe; Napoleon
       Bonaparte; Ulysses S. Grant, and General Von Moltke. Among
       the most illustrious benefactors of mankind, as statesmen,
       lawgivers and patriots, stand Moses, David, Solon, Numa
       Pompilius, Zoroaster, Confucius, Justinian, Charlemagne,
       Cromwell, Washington and Lincoln. Eminent among the
       philosophers, rhetoricians and logicians stand Socrates,
       Plato, Aristotle, Seneca, the two Catos, and Lord Bacon;
       among orators, Pericles, Demosthenes, Cicero, Mirabeau,
       Burke, Webster and Clay; among poets, Homer, Virgil, Dante,
       Milton, and Shakespeare; among painters and sculptors,
       Phidias, Parrhasius, Zenxis, Praxiteles, Scopas, Michael
       Angelo, Raphael and Rubens; among philanthropists, John
       Howard; among inventors, Archimedes, Watt, Fulton,
       Arkwright, Whitney and Morse; among astronomers, Copernicus,
       Galileo, Tycho Brahe, Newton, La Place and the elder
       Herschel. Here are sixty names of distinguished men, and yet
       the great religious leaders, excepting Moses and Zoroaster,
       have not been named. Among these stand Siddhartha or Buddha,
       Mahomet, Martin Luther, John Knox and John Wesley. Then the
       great explorers and geographers of the world have not been
       noticed, among whom Herodotus, Strabo, Pliny, Vasco de Gama,
       Columbus and Humboldt barely lead the van.</p>

    <p>Of eminent women there are Seling, wife of the Emperor
    Hwang-ti, B. C. 2637, who taught her people the art of
    silk-raising and weaving; Semiramis, the Assyrian Queen;
    Deborah, the heroic warrior prophetess of the Israelites; Queen
    Esther, who, with the counsel of her cousin, Mordecai, not only
    saved the Jews from extermination, but lifted them from a
    condition of slavery into prosperity and power; Dido, the
    founder of Carthage; Sappho, the eminent Grecian poetess;
    Hypatia, the eloquent philosopher; Mary, the mother of Christ;
    Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra; the mother of St. Augustine;
    Elizabeth of Hungary; Queen Elizabeth of England; Queen
    Isabella of Spain; the Empress Maria Theresa; Margaret the
    Great of Denmark; Catherine the Great of Russia, Queen

    and among artists, Rosa Bonheur, and our own Harriet
    Hosmer.</p>

    <p><b>THE SUEZ CANAL.</b>&mdash;The Suez Canal was begun in
    1,858 and was formally opened in November, 1869. Its cost,
    including harbors, is estimated at $100,000,000. Its length is
    100 miles, 75 of which were excavated; its width is generally
    325 feet at the surface, and 75 feet at the bottom, and its
    depth 26 feet. The workmen employed were chiefly natives, and
    many were drafted by the Khedive. The number of laborers is
    estimated at 30,000. The British government virtually controls
    the canal as it owns most of the stock.</p>

    <p><b>SENDING VESSELS OVER NIAGARA FALLS.</b>&mdash;There have
    been three such instances. The first was in 1827. Some men got
    an old ship&mdash;the Michigan&mdash;which had been used on
    lake Erie, and had been pronounced unseaworthy. For mere
    wantonness they put aboard a bear, a fox, a buffalo, a dog and
    some geese and sent it over the cataract. The bear jumped from
    the vessel before it reached the rapids, swam toward the shore,
    and was rescued by some humane persons. The geese went over the
    falls, and came to the shore below alive, and, therefore,
    became objects of great interest, and were sold at high prices
    to visitors at the Falls. The dog, fox, and buffalo were not
    heard of or seen again. Another condemned vessel, the Detroit,
    that had belonged to Commodore Perry's victorious fleet, was
    started over the cataract in the winter of 1841, but grounded
    about midway in the rapids, and lay there till knocked to
    pieces by the ice. A somewhat more picturesque instance was the
    sending over the Canada side of a ship on fire. This occurred
    in 1837. The vessel was the Caroline, which had been run in the
    interest of the insurgents in the Canadian rebellion. It was
    captured by Colonel McNabb, an officer of the Canada militia,
    and by his orders it was set on fire then cut loose from its
    moorings. All in flames, it went glaring and hissing down the
    rapids and over the precipice, and smothered its ruddy blaze in
    the boiling chasm below. Thia was witnessed by large crowds on
    both sides of the falls, and was described as a most
    magnificent sight. Of course there was no one on board the
    vessel.</p>

    <p><b>LIFE OF ETHAN ALLEN.</b>&mdash;Colonel Ethan Allan was
    captured in an attack upon Montreal, September 25, 1775. He was
    sent as prisoner to Great Britain, ostensibly for trial, but in
    a few months was sent back to America, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"
       id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span> in prison ships and jails at
       Halifax and New York till May 3, 1778, when he was
       exchanged. During most of his captivity he was treated as a
       felon and kept heavily ironed, but during 1777 was allowed
       restricted liberty on parole. After his exchange he again
       offered his services to the patriot army, but because of
       trouble in Vermont was put in command of the militia in that
       State. The British authorities were at that time making
       especial efforts to secure the allegiance of the Vermonters,
       and it was owing to Allen's skillful negotiations that the
       question was kept open until the theater of war was changed,
       thus keeping the colony on the American side, but avoiding
       the attacks from the British that would certainly have
       followed an open avowal of their political preferences.
       Allen died at Burlington, Vt., February 13, 1789.</p>

    <p><b>BURIAL CUSTOMS.</b>&mdash;Among the early Christians the
    dead were buried with the face upward and the feet toward the
    east, in token of the resurrection at the coming again of the
    Sun of Righteousness. It cannot be said, however, that the
    custom was first used by the Christians. It was in practice
    among early pagan nations also, and is regarded as a survival
    of the ideas of the fire-worshipers. The sun, which was the
    impersonation of deity to many primitive races, had his home in
    their mythology in the east, and out of respect for him the
    dead were placed facing this quarter, among certain tribes
    always in a sitting posture. It may also be remarked that among
    other races the position was reversed, the dead body being
    placed with its feet toward the west, because the region of
    sunset was the home of the departed spirits.</p>

    <p><b>THE SURRENDER OF LEE TO GRANT.</b>&mdash;The surrender of
    General Lee was made at the house of a farmer named McLean, in
    Appomattox village, that house having been selected by General
    Lee himself at General Grant's request for the interview.
    General Grant went thither, and was met by General Lee on the
    threshold. The two went into the parlor of the house, a small
    room, containing little furnishing but a table and several
    chairs. About twenty Union officers besides General Grant were
    present, among them the members of the General's staff. The
    only Confederate officer with General Lee was Colonel Marshall,
    who acted as his secretary. General Lee, as well as his aid,
    was in full uniform, and wore a burnished sword which was given
    him by the State of Virginia; General Grant was in plain
    uniform, without a sword. After a brief conversation, relative
    to the meeting of the two generals while soldiers in Mexico,
    General Lee adverted at once to the object of the interview by
    asking on what terms the surrender of his army would be
    received. General Grant replied that officers and men must
    become prisoners of war, giving up of course all munitions,
    weapons and supplies, but that a parole would be accepted.
    General Lee then requested that the terms should be put in
    writing, that he might sign them. General Badeau says that
    while General Grant was writing the conditions of surrender he
    chanced to look up and his eye caught the glitter of General
    Lee's sword, and that this sight induced him to insert the
    provision that the "officers should be allowed to retain their
    side-arms, horses and personal property." This historian thinks
    that General Lee fully expected to give up his sword, and that
    General Grant omitted this from the terms of surrender out of
    consideration for the feelings of a soldier. Badeau says that
    General Lee was evidently much touched by the clemency of his
    adversary in this regard. The Confederate chief now wrote his
    acceptance of the terms offered and signed them. lie further
    requested that the cavalry and artillery soldiers might be
    allowed to retain their horses as well as the officers, to
    which General Grant consented, and asked that a supply train
    left at Danville might be allowed to pass on, as his soldiers
    were without food. The reply of General Grant to this was an
    order that 25,000 rations should be immediately issued from the
    commissariat of the National army to the Army of Northern
    Virginia. The formal papers were now drawn up and signed, and
    the interview which ended one of the greatest wars of modern
    times was over.</p>

    <p><b>ARCTIC EXPLORATIONS.</b>&mdash;From 1496 to 1857 there
    were 134 voyages and land journeys undertaken by governments
    and explorers of Europe and America to investigate the unknown
    region around the North Pole. Of these, sixty-three went to the
    northwest, twenty-nine via Behring Straits, and the rest to the
    northeast or due north. Since 1857 there have been the notable
    expeditions of Dr. Hayes, of Captain Hall, those of
    Nordenskjold, and others sent by Germany, Russia and Denmark;
    three voyages made by James Lament, of the Royal Geographical
    Society, England, at his own expense; the expeditions of Sir
    George Nares, of Leigh Smith, and that of the ill-fated
    Jeannette; the search expeditions of the Tigress, the Juniata,
    and those sent to rescue Lieutenant Greely; further, all the
    expeditions fitted out under the auspices of the Polar
    Commission&mdash;in which the Greely expedition was
    included&mdash;and a number of minor voyages, making a sum
    total of some sixty exploring journeys in these twenty-seven
    years.</p>

    <p><b>THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO.</b>&mdash;The battle of Waterloo
    was fought June 18, 1815, between the allied British,
    Netherland and German troops under Wellington and the French
    under Napoleon. On June 16 Napoleon had attacked the Prussians
    under Blucher at Ligny and forced them to retreat toward Wavre,
    and Marshal Noy at the same time attacked the British and Dutch
    forces at Quatre Bras, but was forced to retire after an
    engagement of five hours. Napoleon's object, however, which was
    to prevent a union of the Prussians with Wellington's main
    army, was partially gained. The latter commander, having
    learned the next morning of Blucher's repulse, moved on to
    Waterloo expecting that the Prussian commander, according to
    previous arrangement, would join him there as speedily as
    possible. On June 17 Napoleon also moved toward Waterloo with
    the main body of his army, having directed Marshal Grouchy with
    34,000 men and ninety-six guns to pursue Blucher's command
    toward Wavre. Both armies bivouacked on the field of Waterloo,
    and the next morning Napoleon, confident that Grouchy would
    prevent the arrival of the Prussians, delayed attack until the
    ground should become dry, a heavy shower having fallen on the
    day previous. The forces under Wellington occupied a
    semi-circular ridge a mile and a half in length, and the French
    were on an opposite ridge, the two being separated by a valley
    about 500 yards wide. The plan of Napoleon was to turn the
    allied left, force it back upon center, and gain possession of
    the enemy's line of retreat. To draw off Wellington's attention
    to his right, French troops were sent about 11 o'clock to
    attack the chateau of Houguemont, which the English had
    fortified. After a <span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"
       id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span> more than two hours this was
       still in the possession of its defenders. About 1 o'clock a
       Prussian corps under Bulow was seen approaching on the
       French right, and Napoleon, finding it necessary to send
       10,000 men to check their advance, was obliged to change the
       plan of battle. He therefore ordered a fierce attack upon
       the allied center. Wellington massed his troops there, and
       the battle was obstinately maintained for five hours, with
       varying success to the participants, both commanders hourly
       expecting re-enforcements. Wellington was waiting for
       Blucher and Napoleon for Grouchy. The French at last were
       gaining ground; the allied troops in the center were
       wavering under Ney's impetuous onslaughts, General Durutte
       had forced back the left, and Bulow's troops on the right
       had been forced to yield the position they had taken. Now,
       however, there were rumors that Blucher's army was
       approaching and the allies again rallied. At 7 o'clock
       Napoleon, despairing of the approach of Grouchy, determined
       to decide the day by a charge of the Old Guard, which had
       been held in reserve. At this stage the advance of Prussian
       horse on the allied left forced back General Durutte's
       troops, and the Old Guard formed in squares to cover this
       retreat. Ney's division surrounded, made a gallant
       struggle&mdash;their brave leader still unwounded, though
       five horses had been shot under him, heading them on foot,
       sword in hand&mdash;but were forced to give way. The Old
       Guard held their ground against overwhelming numbers.
       Finally, when five squares were broken, the Emperor gave the
       order to "fall back." The cry "The Guard is repulsed" spread
       consternation through the French army and threatened to turn
       retreat into precipitate flight. Napoleon, seeing this,
       reformed the Guard in order to give a rallying point for the
       fugitives. Failing in this, he declared that he would die
       within the square, but Marshal Soult hurried him away. The
       heroic band, surrounded, was bidden to surrender. "The Old
       Guard dies, but never surrenders" is the reply popularly
       attributed to General Cambronne, and with the cry of "Vive
       l'Empereur!" the remnant of the Guard made a last charge
       upon the enemy and perished almost to a man. The forces of
       Blucher being now upon the field, the rout of the French was
       complete, and the Prussians pursued the fleeing troops,
       capturing guns and men. There is no doubt that the failure
       of Grouchy to come upon the field caused Napoleon to lose
       his last great battle. It was subsequently asserted that
       this marshal was bribed, but there seems to be no real
       foundation for so base a charge. The trouble was that he had
       been ordered by Napoleon to follow the Prussians toward
       Wavre and thought it necessary to follow the strict letter
       of his instructions. Before he reached the village the main
       body of the Prussian force was on its way to Waterloo, but
       one division had been left there to occupy his attention.
       Engaged in skirmishing with this, he paid no attention to
       the advice of his subordinate generals who, hearing the
       terrible cannonading at Waterloo, besought him to go to the
       aid of the army there. Napoleon believing that he was either
       holding back Blucher's forces or was hotly pursuing them,
       did not recall him to the main army, and the decisive battle
       was lost. Grouchy was summoned before a council of war, but
       the court declared itself incompetent to decide his case,
       and nothing further came of it.</p>

    <p><b>OUR NATIONAL CEMETERIES.</b>&mdash;National Cemeteries
    for soldiers and sailors may be said to have originated in
    1850, the army appropriation bill of that year appropriating
    money for a cemetery near the City of Mexico, for the interment
    of the remains of soldiers who fell in the Mexican War. The
    remains of Federal soldiers and sailors who fell in the war for
    the Union have been buried in seventy-eight cemeteries
    exclusive of those interred elsewhere, a far greater
    number.</p>

    <p>In the subjoined list are given the names and locations of
    the National Cemeteries with the number therein buried, known
    and unknown. We have no means of knowing what cemeteries also
    contain the bodies of Southern soldiers:</p>

    <p><b>THE CATACOMBS OF PARIS.</b>&mdash;The so-called catacombs
    of Paris were never catacombs in the ancient sense of the word,
    and were not devoted to purposes of sepulture until 1784. In
    that year the Council of State issued a decree for clearing the
    Cemetery of the Innocents, and for removing its contents, as
    well as those of other graveyards, into the quarries which had
    existed from the earlier times under the city of Paris and
    completely undermined the southern part of the city. Engineers
    and workmen were sent to examine the quarries and to prop up
    their roofs lest the weight of buildings above should break
    them in. April 7, 1786, the consecration of the catacombs was
    performed with great solemnity, and the work of removal from
    the cemeteries was immediately begun. This work was all
    performed by night; the bones were brought in funeral cars,
    covered with a pall, and followed by priests chanting the
    service of the dead, and when they reached the catacombs the
    bones were shot down the shaft. As the cemeteries were cleared
    by order of the government, their contents were removed to this
    place of general deposit, and these catacombs further served as
    convenient receptacles for those who perished in the
    revolution. At first the bones were heaped up without any kind
    of order except that those from each cemetery were kept
    separate, but in 1810 a regular system of arranging them was
    commenced, and the skulls and bones were built up along the
    wall. From the main entrance to the catacombs, which is near
    the barriers d'Enfer, a flight of ninety steps descends, at
    whose foot galleries are seen branching in various directions.
    Some yards distant is a vestibule of octagonal form, which
    opens into a long gallery lined with bones from floor to roof.
    The arm, leg and thigh bones are in front, closely and
    regularly piled, and their uniformity is relieved by three rows
    of skulls at equal distances. Behind these are thrown the
    smaller bones. This gallery conducts to several rooms
    resembling chapels, lined with bones variously arranged. One is
    called the "Tomb of the Revolution." another the "Tomb of
    Victims," the latter containing the relics of those who
    perished in the early period of the revolution and in the
    "Massacre of September." It is estimated that the remains of
    3,000,000 human beings lie in this receptacle. Admission to
    these catacombs has for years been strictly forbidden on
    account of the unsafe condition of the roof. They are said to
    comprise an extent of about 3,250,000 square yards.</p>

    <p><b>HISTORY OF THE TELEPHONE.</b>&mdash;The principle of the
    telephone, that sounds could be conveyed to a distance by a
    distended wire, was demonstrated by Robert Hook in 1667, but no
    practical application was made of the discovery until 1821,
    when Professor Wheatstone exhibited his "Enchanted Lyre," in
    which the sounds of a music-box were conveyed from a cellar to
    upper rooms. The first true discoverer of the speaking
    telephone, however, was Johaun Philipp Reis, a German scientist
    and professor in the institute at Friedrichsdorf. April 25,
    1861, Reis exhibited his telephone at Frankfort. This contained
    all the essential features of the modern telephone, but as its
    commercial value was not at all comprehended, little attention
    was paid to it. Reis, after trying in vain to arouse the
    interest of scientists in his discovery, died in 1874, without
    having reaped any advantage from it, and there is no doubt that
    his death was hastened by the distress of mind caused by his
    continual rebuffs. Meanwhile, the idea was being worked into
    more practical shape by other persons, Professor Elisha Gray
    and Professor A.G. Bell, and later by Edison. There is little
    doubt that Professor Gray's successful experiments considerably
    antedated those of the others, but Professor Bell was the first
    to perfect his patent. February 12, 1877, Bell's articulating
    telephone was tested by experiments at Boston and Salem, Mass.,
    and was found to convey sounds distinctly from one place to the
    other, a distance of eighteen miles. This telephone was
    exhibited widely in this country and in Europe during that
    year, and telephone companies were established to bring it into
    general use. Edison's carbon "loud-speaking" telephone was
    brought out in 1878. It is not worth while to go into details
    of the suits on the subject of priority of invention. The
    examiner of patents at Washington, July 21, 1883, decided that
    Professor Bell was the first inventor, because he was the first
    to complete his invention and secure a full patent. Since 1878
    there have been many improvements in the different parts of the
    telephone, rendering it now nearly perfect in its working.</p>

    <p><b>THE EARTHQUAKE OF 1811-12.</b>&mdash;The earthquake
    shocks felt on the shores of the Lower Mississippi in the years
    1811-12 are recorded as among the most remarkable phenomena of
    their kind. Similar instances where earth disturbances have
    prevailed, severely and continuously, far from the vicinity of
    a volcano, are very rare indeed. In this instance, over an
    extent of country stretching for 300 miles southward from the
    mouth of the Ohio river, the ground rose and sank in great
    undulations, and lakes were formed and again drained. The
    shocks were attended by loud explosions, great
    fissures&mdash;generally traveling from northeast to southwest,
    and sometimes more than half a mile in length&mdash;were opened
    in the earth, and from these openings mud and water were thrown
    often to the tops of the highest trees. Islands in the
    Mississippi were sunk, the current of the river was driven back
    by the rising of its bed, and overflowed the adjacent lands.
    More than half of New Madrid county was permanently submerged.
    The inhabitants noticed that these earth movements were
    sometimes vertical and sometimes horizontal, the former being
    by far the most serious in their effects. These disturbances
    ceased March 26, 1812, simultaneously with the great earthquake
    which destroyed the city of Caracas, South America.</p>

    <p><b>THE DARK DAYS IN NEW ENGLAND.</b>&mdash;On May 19, 1780,
    there was a remarkable darkening of the sky and atmosphere over
    a large part of New England, which caused
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"
       id="page62"></a>[pg 62]</span> much alarm among those who
       witnessed it. The darkness began between ten and eleven
       o'clock on the day named, and continued in some places
       through the entire day, and was followed by an unusually
       intense degree of blackness during the ensuing night. This
       phenomenon extended from the northeastern part of New
       England westward as far as Albany, and southward to the
       coast of New Jersey. The most intense and prolonged
       darkness, however, was confined to Massachusetts, especially
       to the eastern half of the State. It came up from the
       southwest, and overhung the country like a pall. It was
       necessary to light candles in all the houses, and thousands
       of good people, believing that the end of all things
       terrestrial had come, betook themselves to religious
       devotions. One incident of the occasion has been woven into
       verse with excellent effect by the poet Whittier. The
       Connecticut Legislature was in session on that day, and as
       the darkness came on and grew more and more dense, the
       members became terrified, and thought that the day of
       judgment had come; so a motion was made to adjourn. At this,
       a Mr. Davenport arose and said: "Mr. Speaker, it is either
       the day of judgment, or it is not. If it is not, there is no
       need of adjourning. If it is, I desire to be found doing my
       duty. I move that candles be brought and that we proceed to
       business." Mr. Davenport's suggestion was taken, candles
       were brought in, and business went on as usual. As to the
       explanation of this phenomenon, scientists have been much
       puzzled. It was plain from the falling of the barometer that
       the air was surcharged with heavy vapor. The darkness then,
       it might be said, was only the result of a dense fog, but
       the question of the cause of so remarkable a fog was still
       unanswered. Omitting this unascertained primary cause, then,
       Professor Williams, of Harvard College, who subsequently
       made a thorough investigation of the matter, gave it as his
       opinion that this unprecedented quantity of vapor had
       gathered in the air in layers so as to cut off the rays of
       light, by repeated refraction, in a remarkable degree. He
       thought that the specific gravity of this vapor must have
       been the same as that of the air, which caused it to be held
       so long in suspension in the atmosphere. In this case the
       extent of the darkness would coincide with the area of the
       vapor, and it would continue until a change in the gravity
       of the air caused the vapors to ascend or descend. In some
       places when the darkness cleared it was as if the vapor was
       lifted and borne away by the wind like a dark pall, and in
       others, after a period of intense darkness the atmosphere
       gradually lightened again. In our day, a phenomenon of this
       kind would be thoroughly investigated to its most remote
       possible cause; but then owing to the sparse settlement of
       the country and the difficulties of travel, the
       investigation of distant causes could not be made. Large
       fires may have prevailed that spring in the forests of
       Western New York and Pennsylvania&mdash;a region then an
       absolute wilderness&mdash;the smoke of which was borne
       through the upper regions of the atmosphere, to fall when it
       came to a locality of less buoyant air, down to the lower
       strata. We say these fires may have recently preceded this
       day, and served as its sufficient cause, but we have only
       presumptive evidence that they did occur. Had Professor
       Williams entertained a supposition of the previous existence
       of such fires, he had then no means of verifying it, and
       long before the advent of railroads and telegraphs, or even
       of stage lines, the scientific theories of the dark day had
       passed from the general memory.</p>

    <p><b>A SHORT HISTORY OF THE LIBERTY BELL.</b>&mdash;In 1751
    the Pennsylvania Assembly authorized a committee to procure a
    bell for their State House. November 1st of that year an order
    was sent to London for "a good bell of about 2,000 pounds
    weight." To this order were added the following directions:
    "Let the bell be cast by the best workmen and examined
    carefully before it is shipped, with the following words well
    shaped in large letters around it, viz.: 'By order of the
    Assembly of the Province of Pennsylvania, for the State House,
    in the city of Philadelphia, 1752.' And underneath, 'Proclaim
    Liberty Through All the Land Unto All the Inhabitants
    Thereof.&mdash;Levit. xxv. 10.'" In due time, in the following
    year, the bell reached Philadelphia, but when it was hung,
    early in 1753, as it was being first rung to test the sound, it
    cracked without any apparent reason, and it was necessary to
    have it recast. It was at first thought to be necessary to send
    it back to England for the purpose, but some "ingenious
    workmen" in Philadelphia wished to do the casting and were
    allowed to do so. In the first week of June, 1753, the bell was
    again hung in the belfry of the State House. On July 4, 1776,
    it was known throughout the city that the final decision on the
    question of declaring the colonies independent of Great Britain
    was to be made by the Continental Congress, in session at the
    State House. Accordingly the old bellman had been stationed in
    the belfry on that morning, with orders to ring the bell when a
    boy waiting at the door of the State House below should signal
    to him that the bill for independence had been passed. Hour
    after hour the old man stood at his post. At last, at 2
    o'clock, when he had about concluded that the question would
    not be decided on that day at least, the watchman heard a shout
    from below, and looking down saw the boy at the door clapping
    his hands and calling at the top of his voice: "Ring! ring!"
    And he did ring, the story goes, for two whole hours, being so
    filled with excitement and enthusiasm that he could not stop.
    When the British threatened Philadelphia, in 1777, the precious
    bell was taken down and removed to the town of Bethlehem for
    safety. In 1778 it was returned to the State House and a new
    steeple built for it. Several years after it cracked, for some
    unknown reason, under a stroke of the clapper, and its tone was
    thus destroyed. An attempt was made to restore its tone by
    sawing the crack wider, but without success. This bell was sent
    to New Orleans during the winter to be exhibited in the World's
    Fair there. The Pullman Company gave one of their handsomest
    cars for the transit. It was in the charge of three custodians
    appointed by the Mayor of Philadelphia, who did not leave it
    night or day, and guarded it as fully as possible against
    accident. A pilot engine preceded the train carrying the bell
    over the entire route. It left Philadelphia Jan. 24, 1885, and
    returned in June.</p>

    <p><b>THE ANTARCTIC POLAR REGIONS.</b>&mdash;The climate of the
    southern polar regions is much more severe than that at the
    north pole, the icefields extending in degrees nearer the
    equator from the south than from the north. Within the arctic
    circle there are tribes of men living on the borders of the icy
    ocean on both the east and west hemispheres, but within the
    antarctic all is one dreary, uninhabitable waste. In the
    extreme north the reindeer and the musk-ox are found in
    numbers, but not a single land quadruped exists beyond 50
    degrees of southern latitude. Flowers are seen in summer by the
    arctic navigator as far as 78 degrees north, but no plant of
    any description, not even a moss or a lichen, has been observed
    beyond Cockburn Island, in 64 degrees 12 minutes south
    latitude. In Spitzbergen, 79 degrees north, vegetation ascends
    the mountain slopes to a height of 3,000 feet, but on every
    land within or near the antarctic circle the snow-line descends
    to the water's edge. The highest latitude ever reached at the
    south is 78 degrees 10 minutes, while in the north navigators
    have penetrated to 84 degrees. The reason for this remarkable
    difference is the predominance of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"
       id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span> large tracts of land in the
       northern regions, while in the south is a vast expanse of
       ocean. In the north continental masses form an almost
       continuous belt around the icy sea, while in the southern
       hemisphere the continents taper down into a broad extent of
       frigid waters. In the north the plains of Siberia and of the
       Hudson's Bay territories, warmed by the sunbeams of summer,
       become at that season centers of radiating heat, while the
       antarctic lands, of small extent, isolated in the midst of a
       polar ocean and chilled by cold sea winds, act at every
       season as refrigerators of the atmosphere. Further in the
       north the cold currents of the polar sea, having but two
       openings of any estent through which they can convey drift
       ice, have their chilly influence confined to comparatively
       narrow limits, but the cold currents of the antarctic seas
       have scope to branch out freely on all sides and carry their
       ice even into temperate waters. Finally, at the northern
       hemisphere, the Gulf Stream conveys warmth even to the
       shores of Spitzbergen and Nova Zembla, while on the opposite
       regions of the globe no traces of warm currents have been
       observed beyond 55 degrees of south latitude.</p>

    <p><b>THE LANGUAGE USED BY CHRIST.</b>&mdash;The language used
    by Christ was the Aramaic, the dialect of Northern Syria. The
    Israelites were much in contact with Aram&aelig;an populations,
    and some words from that tongue became incorporated into the
    Hebrew at a very early date. At the time of Hezekiah, Aramaic
    had become the official language of both Judea and Assyria:
    that is, the language spoken at the courts. After the fall of
    Samaria the Hebrew inhabitants of Northern Israel were largely
    carried into captivity, and their place was taken by colonists
    from Syria, who probably spoke Aramaic as their mother tongue.
    The fall of the Jewish Kingdom hastened the decay of Hebrew as
    a spoken language&mdash;not that the captives forgot their own
    language, as is generally assumed, but after the return to
    Judea the Jews found themselves, a people few in number, among
    a large number of surrounding populations using the Aramaic
    tongue. When the latest books of the Old Testament were
    written, Hebrew, though still the language of literature, had
    been supplanted by Aramaic as the language of common life. From
    that time on the former tongue was the exclusive property of
    scholars, and has no history save that of a merely literary
    language.</p>

    <p><b>HOW ANCIENT TEMPLES AND PYRAMIDS WERE
    BUILT.</b>&mdash;This is beyond modern conjecture, so imperfect
    is our understanding of the extent of the mechanical knowledge
    of the ancients. Their appliances are believed to have been of
    the simplest order, and their implements exceedingly crude, and
    yet they were able to convey these enormous blocks of stones
    for vast distances, over routes most difficult, and having
    accomplished this, to raise them to great height, and fit them
    in place without the aid of either cement or mortar to cover up
    the errors of the stonecutter. How all this was done is one of
    the enigmas of modern science. It has been generally believed
    that inclined planes of earth were used to enable the workmen
    to raise the huge stones to their places, the earth being
    cleared away afterward. But it is possible that the ancients
    had a more extended knowledge of mechanical powers than we
    usually give them credit for, and that they made use of
    machinery very like that employed by moderns for lifting great
    weights. Large cavities are found in some of the stones in the
    pyramids, which may have been worn by the foot of a derrick
    turning in them. That there were enormous numbers of men
    employed in the building of these ancient structures is well
    known; these results of their great aggregated strength we see,
    but they left no record of the means by which this strength was
    focused and brought most effectually to bear on their mighty
    tasks.</p>

    <p><b>THE FIRST ATLANTIC CABLE.</b>&mdash;As early as 1842
    Professor Morse declared a submarine cable connection between
    America and Europe to be among the possibilities, but no
    attempt toward this great achievement was made until 1854, when
    Cyrus Field established a company, which secured the right of
    landing cables in Newfoundland for fifty years. In 1858
    soundings between Ireland and Newfoundland were completed,
    showing a maximum depth of 4,400 meters. Having succeeded in
    laying a cable between Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, Mr. Field
    secured the co-operation of English capitalists in his
    enterprise. The laying of the cable was begun August 7, 1857,
    from the port of Valencia, Ireland, but on the third day it
    broke, and the expedition had to return. Early in the following
    year another attempt was made. The cable was laid from both
    ends at the same time, was joined in mid-ocean, but in lowering
    it was broken. Again, in the same year, the attempt was made,
    and this time connection was successfully made. The first
    message over the line was sent August 7, 1858. The insulation
    of this cable, however, was defective, and by September 4th had
    quite failed. Some time was now spent in experiments, conducted
    by scientists, to secure a more perfect cable. A new company
    was formed, and in 1865 the work again began. The Great Eastern
    was employed to lay the cable, but when it was partly laid
    serious defects in the line were discovered and in repairing
    these it broke. The apparatus for recovering the wire proving
    insufficient the vessel returned to England. A new company,
    called the Anglo-American, was formed in 1865, and again the
    Great Eastern was equipped for the enterprise. The plan of the
    new expedition was not only to lay a new cable, but also to
    take up the end of the old one and join it to a new piece, thus
    obtaining a second telegraph line. The vessel sailed from
    Valencia July 13, 1866, and July 27 the cable was completely
    laid to Heart's Content, Newfoundland, and a message announcing
    the fact sent over the wire to Lord Stanley. Queen Victoria
    sent a message of congratulation to President Buchanan on the
    28th. September 2d the lost cable of 1865 was recovered and its
    laying completed at Newfoundland September 8, 1866.</p>

    <p><b>ENGRAVING ON EGGS.</b>&mdash;The art of engraving on eggs
    is very puzzling to the uninitiated, but in reality it is very
    simple. It merely consists in writing upon the egg-shell with
    wax or varnish, or simply with tallow, and then immersing the
    egg in some weak acid, such, for example, as vinegar, dilute
    hydrochloric acid, or etching liquor. Wherever the varnish or
    wax has not protected the shell, the lime of the latter is
    decomposed and dissolved in the acid, and the writing or
    drawing remains in relief. In connection with this art a
    curious incident is told in history. In the month of August,
    1808, at the time of the Spanish war, there was found in a
    church in Lisbon an egg, on which was plainly foretold the
    utter destruction of the French, who then had control of the
    city. The story of the wonderful prophecy spread through the
    town, causing the greatest excitement among the superstitious
    populace, and a general uprising was expected. This, however,
    the French commander cleverly thwarted by causing a
    counter-prophecy, directly denying the first, to be engrossed
    on several hundred eggs, which were then distributed in various
    parts of the city. The astonished Portuguese did not know what
    to think of this new phenomenon, but its "numerousness," if we
    may so call it, caused it to altogether outweigh the influence
    of the first prediction, and there were no further symptoms of
    revolt against the French.</p>

    <p><b>CAYENNE PEPPER.</b>&mdash;The name of the plant genus
    from which cayenne pepper is obtained is capsicum, a name also
    given to the product of the plant. This genus belongs to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"
       id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span> the solanace&aelig;, or night
       shade family, and has no relation to the family
       piperace&aelig;, which produces the shrub yielding black
       pepper. The plant which yields cayenne pepper is identical
       with the common red pepper of our gardens. It is an annual,
       a native of tropical countries, where it thrives luxuriantly
       even in the dryest soils, but it is also cultivated in other
       parts of the world. It grows to the height of two or three
       feet, and bears a fruit in the shape of a conical pod or
       seed-vessel, which is green when immature, but bright
       scarlet or orange when ripe. This pod, with its seeds, has a
       very pungent taste, and is used when green for pickling, and
       when ripe and dried is ground to powder to make cayenne
       pepper, or is used for medicine. This powder has a strongly
       stimulating effect, and is believed to aid digestion. It is
       also employed externally to excite the action of the
       skin.</p>

    <p><b>THE BIG TREES OF CALIFORNIA.</b>&mdash;There are several
    groves of Big Trees in California, the most famous of which are
    the Calaveras grove and the Mariposa grove. The Calaveras grove
    occupies what may be described as a band or belt 3,200 feet
    long and 700 in width. It is between two slopes, in a
    depression in the mountains, and has a stream winding through
    it, which runs dry in the summer time. In this grove the Big
    Trees number ninety-three, besides a great many smaller ones,
    which would be considered very large if it were not for the
    presence of these monarchs of the forest. Several of the Big
    Trees have fallen since the grove was discovered, one has been
    cut down, and one had the bark stripped from it to the height
    116 feet from the ground. The highest now standing is the
    "Keystone State," 325 feet high and 45 feet in circumference;
    and the largest and finest is the "Empire State." There are
    four trees over 300 feet in height, and 40 to 61 feet in
    circumference. The tree which was cut down occupied five men
    twenty-two days, which would be at the rate of one man 110
    days, or nearly four months' work, not counting Sundays. Pump
    augers were used for boring through the giant. After the trunk
    was severed from the stump it required five men with immense
    wedges for three days to topple it over. The bark was eighteen
    inches thick. The tree would have yielded more than 1,000 cords
    of four-foot wood and 100 cords of bark, or more than 1,100
    cords in all. On the stump of the tree was built a house,
    thirty feet in diameter, which the Rev. A.H. Tevis, an
    observant traveler, says contains room enough in square feet,
    if it were the right shape, for a parlor 12x10 feet, a
    dining-room 10x12, a kitchen 10x12, two bed-rooms 10 feet
    square each, a pantry 4x8, two clothes-presses 1-1/2 feet deep
    and 4 feet wide, and still have a little to spare! The Mariposa
    grove is part of a grant made by Congress to be set apart for
    public use, resort and recreation forever. The area of the
    grant is two miles square and comprises two distinct groves
    about half a mile apart. The upper grove contains 365 trees, of
    which 154 are over fifteen feet in diameter, besides a great
    number of smaller ones. The average height of the Mariposa
    trees is less than that of the Calaveras, the highest Mariposa
    tree being 272 feet; but the average size of the Mariposa is
    greater than that of Calaveras. The "Grizzly Giant," in the
    lower grove, is 94 feet in circumference and 31 feet in
    diameter; it has been decreased by burning. Indeed, the forests
    at times present a somewhat unattractive appearance, as, in the
    past, the Indians, to help them in their hunting, burned off
    the chaparral and rubbish, and thus disfigured many of these
    splendid trees by burning off nearly all the bark. The first
    branch of the "Grizzly Giant" is nearly two hundred feet from
    the ground and is six feet in diameter. The remains of a tree,
    now prostrate, indicate that it had reached a diameter of about
    forty feet and a height of 400 feet; the trunk is hollow and
    will admit of the passage of three horsemen riding abreast.
    There are about 125 trees of over forty feet in circumference.
    Besides these two main groves there are the Tolumne grove, with
    thirty big trees; the Fresno grove, with over eight hundred
    spread over an area of two and a half miles long and one to two
    broad; and the Stanislaus grove, the Calaveras group, with from
    700 to 800. There should be named in this connection the
    petrified forest near Calitoga, which contains portions of
    nearly one hundred distinct trees of great size, scattered over
    a tract of three or four miles in extent: the largest of this
    forest is eleven feet in diameter at the base and sixty feet
    long. It is conjectured that these prostrate giants were
    silicified by the eruption of the neighboring Mount St. Helena,
    which discharged hot alkaline waters containing silica in
    solution. This petrified forest is considered one of the great
    natural wonders of California.</p>

    <p><b>HISTORY OF THE CITY OF JERUSALEM.</b>&mdash;The earliest
    name of Jerusalem appears to have been Jebus, or poetically,
    Salem, and its king in Abraham's time was Melchizedek. When the
    Hebrews took possession of Canaan, the city of Salem was
    burned, but the fortress remained in the hands of the Jebusites
    till King David took it by storm and made it the capital of his
    kingdom. From that time it was called Jerusalem. During the
    reigns of David and Solomon it attained its highest degree of
    power. When ten of the Jewish tribes seceded under Jeroboam
    they made Shechem (and later Samaria) the capital of their
    kingdom of Israel, and Jerusalem remained the capital of the
    smaller but more powerful kingdom of Judah. The city was taken
    by Shishak, King of Egypt, in 971 B.C., was later conquered and
    sacked by Joash, King of Israel, and in the time of Ahaz, the
    King of Syria came against it with a large force, but could not
    take it. The city was besieged in Hezekiah's reign, by the army
    of Sennacherib, King of Assyria, but was saved by the sudden
    destruction of the invading army. After the death of Josiah,
    the city was tributary for some years to the King of Egypt, but
    was taken after repeated attempts by the Babylonians under
    Nebuchadnezzar in 586 B.C., and was left a heap of ruins. The
    work of rebuilding it began by order of King Cyrus about 538
    B.C., who allowed the Jewish people who had been carried into
    captivity to return for this purpose. From this time Jerusalem
    enjoyed comparative peace for several hundred years and grew to
    be an important commercial city. When Alexander invaded Syria
    it submitted to him without resistance. After his death it
    belonged for a time to Egypt and in 198 B.C., passed with the
    rest of Judea under the rule of Syria. Antiochus the Great
    ruled it with mildness and justice, but the tyranny of his son,
    Antiochus Epiphanes, brought about the revolt, headed by the
    Maccabees, through which Jerusalem gained a brief independence.
    In 63 B.C., Pompey the Great took the city, demolished the
    walls and killed thousands of the people, but did not plunder
    it. However, nine years later Crassus robbed the temple of all
    its treasures. The walls were soon after rebuilt under
    Antipater, the Roman procurator, but when Herod came to rule
    over the city with the title of King, given him by the Roman
    Senate, he was resisted and only took possession after an
    obstinate siege, which was followed by the massacre of great
    numbers of the people. Herod improved and enlarged the city,
    and restored the temple on a more magnificent scale than in
    Solomon's time. Jerusalem is said at this time to have had a
    population of over 200,000. This period of wealth and
    prosperity was also rendered most, memorable for Jerusalem by
    the ministry and crucifixion of Christ. About A.D. 66, the
    Jews, goaded to desperation by the tyranny of the Romans,
    revolted, garrisoned Jerusalem, and defeated a Roman army sent
    against <span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"
       id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span> them. This was the beginning
       of the disastrous war which ended with the destruction of
       the city. It was taken by Titus, in the year 70, after a
       long siege, all the inhabitants were massacred, or made
       prisoners, and the entire city left a heap of ruins. The
       Emperor Hadrian built on the site of Jerusalem a Roman city,
       under the name of Elia Capitolina, with a temple of Jupiter,
       and Jews were forbidden to enter the city under pain of
       death. Under Constantine it was made a place of pilgrimage
       for Christians, as the Emperor's mother, Helena, had with
       much pains located the various sites of events in the
       history of Christ. The Emperor Julian, on the contrary, not
       only allowed the Jews to return to their city, but also made
       an attempt, which ended in failure, to rebuild their temple.
       In 614 the Persian Emperor Chosroes invaded the Roman
       empire. The Jews joined his army, and after conquering the
       northern part of Palestine, the united forces laid siege to
       and took Jerusalem. The Jews wreaked vengeance on the
       Christians for what they had been forced to endure, and
       20,000 people were massacred. The Persians held rule in the
       city for fourteen years; it was then taken by the Romans
       again, but in 636 the Caliph Omar beseiged it. After four
       months the city capitulated. It was under the rule of the
       Caliphs for 400 years, until the Seljuk Turks in 1077
       invaded Syria and made it a province of their empire.
       Christian pilgrims had for many years kept up the practice
       of visiting the tomb of Christ, as the Caliphs did not
       interfere with their devotions any further than by exacting
       a small tribute from each visitor. But the cruelties
       practiced upon the pilgrims by the Turks were many, and
       report of them soon roused all Europe to a pitch of
       indignation, and brought about that series of holy wars,
       which for a time restored the holy sepulcher into Christian
       hands. Jerusalem was stormed and taken July 15, 1099, and
       50,000 Moslems were slaughtered by their wrathful Christian
       foes. The new sovereignty was precariously maintained until
       1187, when it fell before the power of Saladin. Jerusalem,
       after a siege of twelve days, surrendered. Saladin, however,
       did not put his captives to death, but contented himself
       with expelling them from the city. Jerusalem passed into the
       hands of the Franks by treaty, in 1229, was retaken by the
       Moslems in 1239, once more restored in 1243, and finally
       conquered in 1244 by a horde of Kharesmian Turks. In 1517
       Palestine was conquered by Sultan Selin I., and since then
       has been under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, except for a
       brief period&mdash;from 1832 to 1840, when it was in the
       hands of Mahomet Ali Pasha of Egypt, and his son Ibrahim had
       his seat of government in Jerusalem.</p>

    <p><b>THE BLACK DEATH.</b>&mdash;- This great plague, known as
    the "Black Death," was the most deadly epidemic ever known. It
    is believed to have been an aggravated outburst of the Oriental
    plague, which from the earliest records of history has
    periodically appeared in Asia and Northern Africa. There had
    been a visitation of the plague in Europe in 1342; the Black
    Death, in terrible virulence, appeared in 1348-9; it also came
    in milder form in 1361-2, and again in 1369. The prevalence and
    severity of the pestilence during this century is ascribed to
    the disturbed conditions of the elements that preceded it. For
    a number of years Asia and Europe had suffered from mighty
    earthquakes, furious tornadoes, violent floods, clouds of
    locusts darkening the air and poisoning it with their
    corrupting bodies. Whether these natural disturbances were the
    cause of the plague is not certainly known, but many writers on
    the subject regard the connection as both probable and
    possible. The disease was brought from the Orient to
    Constantinople, and early in 1347 appeared in Sicily and
    several coast towns of Italy. After a brief pause the
    pestilence broke out at Avignon in January, 1348; advanced
    thence to Southern France, Spain and Northern Italy. Passing
    through France and visiting, but not yet ravaging, Germany, it
    made its way to England, cutting down its first victims at
    Dorset, in August, 1348. Thence it traveled slowly, reaching
    London early in the winter. Soon it embraced the entire
    kingdom, penetrating to every rural hamlet, so that England
    became a mere pest-house. The chief symptoms of the disease are
    described as "spitting, in some cases actual vomiting, of
    blood, the breaking out of inflammatory boils in parts, or over
    the whole of the body, and the appearance of those dark
    blotches upon the skin which suggested its most startling name.
    Some of the victims died almost on the first attack, some in
    twelve hours, some in two days, almost all within the first
    three days." The utter powerlessness of medical skill before
    the disease was owing partly to the physicians' ignorance of
    its nature, and largely to the effect of the spirit of terror
    which hung like a pall over men's minds. After some months had
    passed, the practice of opening the hard boils was adopted,
    with very good effect, and many lives were thus saved. But the
    havoc wrought by the disease in England was terrible. It is
    said that 100,000 persons died in London, nearly 60,000 in
    Norwich, and proportionate numbers in other cities. These
    figures seem incredible, but a recent writer, who has spent
    much time in the investigation of records, asserts that at
    least half the population, or about 2,500,000 souls, of England
    perished in this outbreak. The ravages of the pestilence over
    the rest of the world were no less terrible. Germany is said to
    have lost 1,244,434 victims; Italy, over half the population.
    On a moderate calculation, it may be assumed that there
    perished in Europe during the first appearance of the Black
    Death, fully 25,000,000 human beings. Concerning the Orient we
    have less reliable records, but 13,000,000 are said to have
    died in China, and 24,000,000 in the rest of Asia and adjacent
    islands. The plague also ravaged Northern Africa, but of its
    course there little is known. The horrors of that dreadful time
    were increased by the fearful persecutions visited on the Jews,
    who were accused of having caused the pestilence by poisoning
    the public wells. The people rose to exterminate the hapless
    race, and killed them by fire and torture wherever found. It is
    impossible for us to conceive of the actual horror of such
    times.</p>

    <p><b>MIGHTY HAMMERS.</b>&mdash;An authority on scientific
    subjects give the weights of the great hammers used in the iron
    works of Europe, and their date of manufacture, as follows: At
    the Terni Works, Italy, the heaviest hammer weighs 50 tons, and
    was made in 1873; one at Alexandrovski, Russia, was made the
    following year of like weight. In 1877, one was finished at
    Creusot Works, France, weighing 80 tons; in 1885, one at the
    Cockerill Works, Belgium, of 100 tons, and in 1880, at the
    Krupp Works, Essen, Germany, one of 150 tons. The latter being
    the heaviest hammer in the world.</p>

    <p><b>ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT GARFIELD.</b>&mdash;July 2,
    1881, at 9:25 A.M., as President Garfield was entering the
    Baltimore &amp; Potomac Railroad depot at Washington,
    preparatory to taking the cars for a two weeks' jaunt in New
    England, he was fired upon and severely wounded by Charles
    Jules Guitean, a native of Illinois, but of French descent. The
    scene of the assassination was the ladies' reception-room at
    the station. The President and Mr. Blaine, arm in arm, were
    walking slowly through the aisle between two rows of benches on
    either side of the room; when Guitean entered by a side door on
    the left of the gentlemen, passed quickly around the back of
    the benches till directly behind the President, and fired the
    shot that struck his arm. Mr. Garfield walked about ten feet to
    the end of the aisle, and was in the act of turning to face his
    assailant when the second shot struck him in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"
       id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span> small of the back, and he
       fell. The assassin was immediately seized and taken to jail.
       The wounded president was conveyed in an ambulance to the
       White House. As he was very faint, the first fear was of
       internal hemorrhage, which might cause speedy death. But as
       he rallied in a few hours, this danger was thought to be
       averted and inflammation was now feared. But as symptoms of
       this failed to appear, the surgeons in attendance concluded
       that no important organ had been injured, that the bullet
       would become encysted and harmless, or might possibly be
       located and successfully removed. By the 10th of July, the
       reports were so favorable, that the president's recovery was
       regarded as certain, and public thanksgivings were offered
       in several of the States, by order of the governors, for his
       deliverance. The first check in the favorable symptoms
       occurred on July 18, and July 23 there was a serious
       relapse, attended with chills and fever. The wound had been
       frequently probed but without securing any favorable result.
       The induction balance was used to locate the ball, and was
       regarded as a success, though subsequently its indications
       were known to have been altogether erroneous. The probings,
       therefore, in what was assumed to be the track of the ball,
       only increased the unfavorable symptoms. During the entire
       month of August these reports were alternately hopeful and
       discouraging, the dangerous indications being generally on
       the increase. By August 25, his situation was understood to
       be very critical, though an apparent improvement on the 26th
       and 28th again aroused hope. At his own earnest desire the
       president was removed, September 6, to Elberon Park, near
       Long Branch. N.J., in the hope that the cooler air of the
       seaside might renew his strength more rapidly. However, the
       improvement hoped for did not appear. On September 16, there
       was a serious relapse, with well-marked symptoms of blood
       poisoning, and September 19, the president died. A
       post-mortem examination showed that the ball, after
       fracturing one of the ribs, had passed through the spinal
       column, fracturing the body of one of the vertebra, driving
       a number of small fragments of bone into the soft parts
       adjacent, and lodging below the pancreas, where it had
       become completely encysted. The immediate cause of death was
       hemorrhage from one of the small arteries in the track of
       the ball, but the principal cause was the poisoning of the
       blood from suppuration.</p>

    <p>Turkey&mdash;Gold coins: Lira or medjidie, $4.40; half-lira,
    $2.20; quarter-lira, $1.10. The silver unit is the piastre,
    worth 4 cents of our currency, and silver coins of 1, 2, 5, 10
    and 20 piastres are current.</p>

    <p>The currency of Denmark is also in use in Norway and Sweden,
    these three countries forming the Scandinavian
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"
       id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span> Belgium, France, Greece,
       Italy, Roumania, Servia, Spain and Switzerland are united in
       the Latin Union, and use the French coinage. The units in
       the different States are, it is true, called by different
       names; as in France, Belgium and Switzerland, franc and
       centime; in Italy, lira and centesimo; in Greece, drachm and
       lepta; in Roumania, lei and bani: in Servia, dinar and para;
       in Spain, peseta and centesimo; but in all cases the value
       is the same.</p>

    <p>The similarity in the coinage of different countries is
    worth notice. A very slight change in the percentage of silver
    used would render the half-guilder of Austria, the krone of the
    Scandinavian Union, the franc of the Latin Union, the mark of
    Germany, the half-guilder of Holland, the quarter-ruble of
    Russia, the 200-reis piece of Portugal, the 5-piastre piece of
    Turkey, the half-milreis of Brazil and the half-rupee of India,
    all interchangeable with the English shilling, and all of them
    about the value of the quarter-dollar of North and South
    American coinage. With the exception of Brazil, the other South
    American States, as well as Mexico and the Central American
    countries, are all rapidly approximating a uniform coinage,
    which the needs of commerce will unquestionably soon harmonize
    with that of the United States. Curiously enough, the great
    force that is assimilating the alien branches of the human race
    is not Christianity but trade.</p>

    <p><b>A HISTORY OF THE PANIC OF 1857.</b>&mdash;The cause of
    the panic of 1857 was mainly the rage for land speculation
    which had run through the country like an epidemic. Paper
    cities abounded, unproductive railroads were opened, and to
    help forward these projects, irresponsible banks were started,
    or good banks found themselves drawn into an excessive issue of
    notes. Every one was anxious to invest in real estate and
    become rich by an advance in prices. Capital was attracted into
    this speculation by the prospect of large gains, and so great
    was the demand for money that there was a remarkable advance in
    the rates of interest. In the West, where the speculative fever
    was at its highest, the common rates of interest were from 2 to
    5 per cent. a month. Everything was apparently in the most
    prosperous condition, real estate going up steadily, the demand
    for money constant, and its manufacture by the banks
    progressing successfully, when the failure of the "Ohio Life
    and Trust Company," came, August 24, 1857, like a thunderbolt
    from a clear sky. This was followed by the portentous
    mutterings of a terrible coming storm. One by one small banks
    in Illinois, Ohio, and everywhere throughout the West and South
    went down. September 25-26 the banks of Philadelphia suspended
    payment, and thus wrecked hundreds of banks in Pennsylvania,
    Maryland and adjoining States. October 13-14, after a terrible
    run on them by thousands of depositors, the banks of New York
    suspended payment. October 14 all the banks of Massachusetts
    went down, followed by a general wreckage of credit throughout
    New England. The distress which followed these calamities was
    very great, tens of thousands of workmen being unemployed for
    months. The New York banks resumed payment again December 12,
    and were soon followed by the banks in other cities. The
    darkest period of the crisis now seemed past, although there
    was much heart rending suffering among the poor during the
    winter which followed. The commercial reports for the year 1857
    showed 5,123 commercial failures, with liabilities amounting to
    $291,750,000.</p>

    <p><b>THE HISTORY OF PLYMOUTH ROCK.</b>&mdash;A flat rock near
    the vicinity of New Plymouth is said to have been the one on
    which the great, body of the Pilgrims landed from the
    Mayflower. The many members of the colony, who died in the
    winter of 1620-21, were buried near this rock. About 1738 it
    was proposed to build a wharf along the shore there. At this
    time there lived in New Plymouth an old man over 90 years of
    ago named Thomas Faunce, who had known some of the Mayflower's
    passengers when a lad, and by them had been shown the rock on
    which they had landed. On hearing that it was to be covered
    with a wharf the old man wept, and it has been said that his
    tears probably saved Plymouth Rock from oblivion. After the
    Revolution it was found that the rock was quite hidden by the
    sand washed upon it by the sea. The sand was cleared away, but
    in attempting to take up the rock it was split in two. The
    upper half was taken to the village and placed in the town
    square. In 1834 it was removed to a position in front of
    Pilgrim Hall and enclosed in an iron railing. In September,
    1880, this half of the stone was taken back to the shore and
    reunited to the other portion. A handsome archway was then
    built over the rock, to protect it in part from the
    depredations of relic hunters.</p>

    <p><b>GRANT'S TOUR AROUND THE WORLD.</b>&mdash;General Grant
    embarked on a steamer at the Philadelphia wharf for his tour
    around the world May 17, 1877. He arrived at Queenstown,
    Ireland, May 27. Thence he went to Liverpool, Manchester, and
    on to London. He remained in that city several weeks, and was
    made the recipient of the most brilliant social honors. July
    5th he went to Belgium, and thence made a tour through Germany
    and Switzerland, He then visited Denmark, and August 25
    returned to Great Britain, and until October spent the time in
    visiting the various cities of Scotland and England. October
    24th he started for Paris, where he remained a month, then went
    on to Lyons, thence to Naples, and subsequently with several
    friends he made a trip on the Mediterranean, visiting the
    islands of Sicily, Malta and others. Thence going to Egypt, the
    pyramids and other points of note were visited, and a journey
    made up the Nile as far as the first cataract. The programme of
    travel next included a visit to Turkey and the Holy Land,
    whence, in March, the party came back to Italy through Greece,
    revisited Naples, went to Turin and back to Paris. After a few
    weeks spent in the social gayeties of that city, the
    Netherlands was chosen as the next locality of interest, and
    The Hague, Rotterdam, and Amsterdam were visited in turn. June
    26, 1878, the General and his party arrived in Berlin. After
    staying there some weeks they went to Christiana and Stockholm,
    then to St. Petersburg, Moscow and Warsaw, and back over German
    soil to Vienna. Another trip was now made through Switzerland,
    and, then returning to Paris, a start was made for a journey
    through Spain and Portugal, in which Victoria, Madrid, Lisbon,
    Seville and other important towns were visited. A trip was also
    made from Cadiz to Gibraltar by steamer. After another brief
    visit to Paris, General Grant went to Ireland, arriving at
    Dublin January 3, 1879; visited several points of interest in
    that country, then, by way of London and Paris, went to
    Marseilles, whence he set sail by way of the Mediterranean Sea
    and the Suez Canal for India. He reached Bombay February 13th.
    Thence visited Allahabad, Agra and rode on an elephant to
    Amber; also went to Benares, Delhi. Calcutta and Rangoon, spent
    a week in Siam, then went by steamer to China. After spending
    some time at Canton, Pekin and other places he went to Japan
    for a brief visit. He went to Nagasaki, Tokio and Yokahama, and
    at last, September 3, 1879, set sail from Tokio on his return
    to the United States. September 20th he arrived in the harbor
    of San Francisco. After some weeks spent in visiting the points
    of interest in California and Oregon he returned to his home in
    the Eastern States.</p>

    <p><b>HISTORY OF VASSAR COLLEGE.</b>&mdash;- Vassar College is
    on the east bank of the Hudson, near Poughkeepsie, N.Y. It was
    founded in 1861. In that year Matthew Vassar, a wealthy
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"
       id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span> of Poughkeepsie, gave to an
       incorporated board of trustees the sum of $108,000 and 200
       acres of land for the endowment of a college for women. The
       building was constructed from plans approved by him, at a
       cost of about $200,000. The college was opened in September,
       1865, with eight professors and twenty other instructors,
       and 300 students. The first president of the college was
       Professor Milo P. Jewett; the second Dr. John H. Raymond;
       the third the Rev. Samuel Caldwell. The college has a fine
       library, with scientific apparatus and a museum of natural
       history specimens.</p>

    <p><b>THE ORIGINS OF CHESS.</b>&mdash;So ancient is chess, the
    most purely intellectual of games, that its origin is wrapped
    in mystery. The Hindoos say that it wad the invention of an
    astronomer, who lived more than 5,000 years ago, and was
    possessed of supernatural knowledge and acuteness. Greek
    historians assert that the game was invented by Palamedes to
    beguile the tedium of the siege of Troy. The Arab legend is
    that it was devised for the instruction of a young despot, by
    his father, a learned Brahman, to teach the youth that a king,
    no matter how powerful, was dependent upon his subjects for
    safety. The probability is that the game was the invention of
    some military genius for the purpose of illustrating the art of
    war. There is no doubt, that it originated in India, for a game
    called by the Sanskrit name of Cheturanga&mdash;which in most
    essential points strongly resembles modern chess, and was
    unquestionably the parent of the latter game&mdash;is mentioned
    in Oriental literature as in use fully 2,000 years before the
    Christian area. In its gradual diffusion over the world the
    game has undergone many modifications and changes, but marked
    resemblances to the early Indian game are still to be found in
    it. From India, chess spread into Persia, and thence into
    Arabia, and the Arabs took it to Spain and the rest of Western
    Europe.</p>

    <p><b>THE DARK AGES.</b>&mdash;The Dark Ages is a name often
    applied by historians to the Middle Ages, a term comprising
    about 1,000 years, from the fall of the Roman Empire in the
    fifth century to the invention of printing in the fifteenth.
    The period is called "dark" because of the generally depraved
    state of European society at this time, the subservience of
    men's minds to priestly domination, and the general
    indifference to learning. The admirable civilization that Rome
    had developed and fostered, was swept out of existence by the
    barbarous invaders from Northern Europe, and there is no doubt
    that the first half of the medieval era, at least, from the
    year 500 to 1000, was one of the most brutal and ruffianly
    epochs in history. The principal characteristic of the middle
    ages were the feudal system and the papal power. By the first
    the common people were ground into a condition of almost
    hopeless slavery, by the second the evolution of just and
    equitable governments by the ruling clashes was rendered
    impossible through the intrusion of the pontifical authority
    into civil affairs. Learning did not wholly perish, but it
    betook itself to the seclusion of the cloisters. The
    monasteries were the resort of many earnest scholars, and there
    were prepared the writings of historians, metaphysicians and
    theologians. But during this time man lived, as the historian
    Symonds says, "enveloped in a cowl." The study of nature was
    not only ignored but barred, save only as it ministered in the
    forms of alchemy and astrology to the one cardinal medieval
    virtue&mdash;- credulity. Still the period saw many great
    characters and events fraught with the greatest importance to
    the advancement of the race.</p>

    <p><b>THE GREATEST DEPTH OF THE OCEAN NEVER
    MEASURED.</b>&mdash;The deepest verified soundings are those
    made in the Atlantic Ocean, ninety miles off the island of St.
    Thomas, in the West Indies, 3,875 fathoms, or 23,250 feet
    Deeper water has been reported south of the Grand Bank of
    Newfoundland, over 27,000 feet in depth, but additional
    soundings in that locality did not corroborate this. Some years
    ago, it was claimed that very deep soundings, from 45,000 to
    48,000 feet, had been found off the coast of South America, but
    this report was altogether discredited on additional
    investigation in these localities. The ship Challenger, which
    in 1872-74 made a voyage round the globe for the express
    purpose of taking deep sea soundings in all the oceans, found
    the greatest depth touched in the Pacific Ocean less than 3,000
    fathoms, and the lowest in the Atlantic 3,875 fathoms, as given
    above.</p>

    <p><b>THE ARMY OF THE REVOLUTION.</b>&mdash;It is not
    positively known how many men from the colonies served in the
    war. The official tabular statement indicates a total off
    recorded years of enlistment and not a total of the the men who
    served. Hence, a man who served from April 19, 1775, until the
    formal cessation of hostilities, April 19, 1783 counted as
    eight men in the aggregate. In this basis of enlisted years,
    the following table gives the contribution various States: New
    Hampshire, 12,497; Massachusetts, 69,907; Rhode Island, 5,908;
    Connecticut, 31,939; New York, 17,781; New Jersey, 10,726;
    Pennsylvania, 25,678; Delaware, 2,386; Maryland, 13,912;
    Virginia, 26,678; North Carolina, 7,263; South Carolina, 6,417;
    Georgia, 2,679; Total, 233,771.</p>

    <p><b>THE WORLD'S DECISIVE BATTLES.</b>&mdash;The fifteen
    decisive battles of the world from the fifth century before
    Christ to the beginning of the nineteenth century of the
    present era, are as follows:</p>

    <p>The battle of Marathon, in which the Persian hosts were
    defeated by the Greeks under Miltiades, B.C. 490.</p>

    <p>The defeat of the Athenians at Syracuse, B.C. 413.</p>

    <p>The battle of Arhela, in which the Persians under Darius
    were defeated by the invading Greeks under Alexander the Great,
    B.C. 331.</p>

    <p>The battle of the Metanrus, in which the Carthaginian forces
    under Hasdrubal were overthrown by the Romans, B.C. 207.
    Victory of the German tribes under Arminins over the Roman
    legions under Varus, A.D. 9. (The battle was fought in what is
    now the province of Lippe, Germany, near the source of the
    river Ems.)</p>

    <p>Battle of Chalons, where Attila the terrible King of the
    Huns, was repulsed by the Romans under Aetius, A.D. 451</p>

    <p>Battle of Tours, in which the Saracen Turks invading Western
    Europe were utterly overthrown by the Franks under Charles
    Martel, A.D. 732.</p>

    <p>Battle of Hastings, by which William the Conqueror became
    the ruler of England, Oct. 14, 1066.</p>

    <p>Victory of the French under Joan of Arc over the English at
    Orleans, April 29, 1429.</p>

    <p>Defeat of the Spanish Armada by the English naval force,
    July 29 and 30, 1588.</p>

    <p>Battle of Blenheim, in which the French and Bavarians were
    defeated by the allied armies of Great Britain and Holland
    under the Duke of Marlborough, Aug. 2, 1704.</p>

    <p>Battle of Pultowa, the Swedish army under Charles XII,
    defeated by the Russians under Peter the Great, July 8, 1709.
    Victory of the American army under General Gates over the
    British under General Burgoyne at Saratoga, Oct. 17, 1777.</p>

    <p>Battle of Valmy where the allied armies of Prussia and
    Austria were defeated by the French under Marshal Kellerman.
    Sept. 20, 1792.</p>

    <p>Battle of Waterloo, the allied forces of the British and
    Prussians defeated the French under Napoleon, the final
    overthrow of the great commander, June 18,
    1815.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"
       id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span>

    <p>These battles are selected as decisive, because of the
    important consequences that followed them. Few students of
    history, probably, would agree with Prof. Creasy, in
    restricting the list as he does. Many other conflicts might be
    noted, fraught with great importance to the human race, and
    unquestionably "decisive" in their nature; as, for instance,
    the victory of Sobieski over the Turkish army at Vienna, Sept.
    12, 1683. Had the Poles and Austrians been defeated there, the
    Turkish general might readily have fulfilled his threat "to
    stable his horses in the Church of St. Peter's at Rome," and
    all Western Europe would, no doubt, have been devastated by the
    ruthless and bloodthirsty Ottomans. Of important and decisive
    battles since that of Waterloo we may mention in our own Civil
    War those of Gettysburg, by which the invasion of the North was
    checked, and at Chattanooga, Nov. 23 and 25, 1863, by which the
    power of the Confederates in the southwest received a deadly
    blow.</p>

    <p><b>THE WANDERING JEW.</b>&mdash;There are various versions
    of the story of "The Wandering Jew," the legends of whom have
    formed the foundation of numerous romances, poems and
    tragedies. One version is that this person was a servant in the
    house of Pilate, and gave the Master a blow as He was being
    dragged out of the palace to go to His death. A popular
    tradition makes the wanderer a member of the tribe of Naphtali,
    who, some seven or eight years previous to the birth of the
    Christ-child left his father to go with the wise men of the
    East whom the star led to the lowly cot in Bethlehem. It runs,
    also, that the cause of the killing of the children can be
    traced to the stories this person related when he returned to
    Jerusalem of the visit of the wise men, and the presentation of
    the gifts they brought to the Divine Infant, when He was
    acknowledged by them to be the king of the Jews, He was lost
    sight of for a time, when he appeared as a carpenter who was
    employed in making the cross on which the Saviour was to be
    lifted up into the eyes of all men. As Christ walked up the way
    to Calvary, He had to pass the workshop of this man, and when
    He reached its door, the soldiers, touched by the sufferings of
    the Man of Sorrows, besought the carpenter to allow Him to rest
    there for a little, but he refused, adding insult to a want of
    charity. Then it is said that Christ pronounced his doom, which
    was to wander over the earth until the second coming. Since
    that sentence was uttered, he has wandered, courting death, but
    finding it not, and his punishment, becoming more unbearable as
    the generations come and go. He is said to have appeared in the
    sixteenth, seventeenth, and even as recently as the eighteenth
    century, under the names of Cartaphilus, and Ahasuerus, by
    which the Wandering Jew has been known. One of the legends
    described him as a shoemaker of Jerusalem, at whose door Christ
    desired to rest on the road to Calvary, but the man refused,
    and the sentence to wander was pronounced.</p>

    <p><b>SOME MEMORABLE DARK DAYS.</b>&mdash;During the last
    hundred years there have been an unusually large number of dark
    days recorded. As has been suggested by several writers, this
    may have been the result of the careful scientific observations
    of modern times, as well as of the frequency of these
    phenomena. The dark day in the beginning of this century about
    which so much has been said and written occurred Oct. 21, 1816.
    The first day of the same month and year is also represented as
    "a close dark day." Mr. Thomas Robie, who took observations at
    Cambridge, Mass., has this to offer in regard to the
    phenomenon. "On Oct. 21 the day was so dark that people were
    forced to light candles to eat their dinners by; which could
    not he from an eclipse, the solar eclipse being the fourth of
    that month." The day is referred to by another writer as "a
    remarkable dark day in New England and New York," and it is
    noted, quaintly by a third, that "in October, 1816, a dark day
    occurred after a severe winter in New England." Nov. 26, 1816,
    was a dark day in London, and is described "in the neighborhood
    of Walworth and Camberwell so completely dark that some of the
    coachmen driving stages were obliged to get down and lead their
    horses with a lantern." The famous dark day in America was May
    19, 1780. The phenomenon began about 10 o'clock in the
    forenoon. The darkness increased rapidly, and "in many places
    it was impossible to read ordinary print." There was widespread
    fear. Many thought that the Day of Judgment was at hand. At
    that time the Legislature of Connecticut was in session at
    Hartford. The House of Representatives, being unable to
    transact their business, adjourned. A proposal to adjourn the
    council was under consideration. When the opinion of Colonel
    Davenport was asked, he answered: "I am against an adjournment.
    The day of judgment is approaching or it is not. If it is not,
    there is no cause for adjournment: if it is, I choose to be
    found doing my duty. I wish, therefore, that candles may be
    brought." In Whittier's "Tent on the Beach" is given a
    beautiful poetical version of this anecdote. It is suggested by
    several authorities that the cause of the dark day in 1780
    should be attributed simply to the presence of ordinary clouds
    of very unusual volume and density. These instances are, of
    course, grouped with phenomena of which not a great deal is
    known, and can in no way be classed with those occurrances
    occasioned by the smoke from extensive forest tires, volcanic
    eruptions, or fogs.</p>

    <p><b>THE REMARKABLE STORY OF CHARLIE ROSS.</b>&mdash;Charlie
    Ross was the son of Christian K. Ross of Germantown, Pa., and
    at the time of his disappearance was a little over 4 years of
    age. The child and a brother 6 years old were playing July 1,
    1874, in the streets of Germantown, when a couple of men drove
    up in a buggy and persuaded the children, with promises of toys
    and candies, to get in and ride with them in the vehicle. After
    driving around the place for a little time, the older brother,
    Walter Ross, was put out of the conveyance, and the strangers
    gave him 25 cents, telling him to go to a store near at hand
    and buy some candy and torpedoes for himself and Charlie.
    Walter did as he was told, but when he came out of the store
    the men with Charlie and the vehicle had disappeared. It was
    believed at first by the relatives and friends of the missing
    boy that he would be returned in a short time, as they supposed
    he might have been taken by some drunken men. Time passed,
    however, but no trace of the child had been discovered. In a
    few weeks a letter was received by Mr. Ross to the effect that
    if he would pay $20,000 his son would be returned, but, that
    the parent need not search for Charlie, as all efforts to find
    the abducted boy or his captors would only be attended with
    failure; and it was stated that if this amount was not paid,
    Charlie would be killed. The father answered this and a long
    correspondence ensued, while the search was prosecuted in all
    directions. Mr. Ross wanted the child delivered at the time the
    money was paid, but to this the abductors refused to agree. It
    is stated that more than $50,000 were expended to recover the
    child. At one time two gentlemen were two days in Fifth Avenue
    Hotel, New York, with the $20,000 ransom money to be given to
    the child-thieves, but they did not appear. The search was
    continued, and the officers of the law were looking up any and
    all evidence, until they had located the two men. These were
    found Dec. 4, 1874, committing a burglary in the house of Judge
    Van Brunt, Bay Ridge, L.I.; the burglary was discovered, the
    burglars seen and shot by persons residing in an adjoining
    residence. One of the men was killed instantly, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"
       id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span> lived several hours, and
       confessed that he and his companion had abducted Charlie
       Ross, but that the dead thief, Mosher by name, was the one
       who knew where the boy was secreted. Walter Ross identified
       the burglars as the men who had enticed him and Charlie into
       the buggy. There the case rested. No new fact has been
       developed. The missing child has never been found. Many
       times have children been reported who resembled Charlie, and
       Mr. Ross has traveled far and near in his endless search,
       only to return sadly and report that his boy was still
       missing. No case in recent years has excited such universal
       sympathy as that of Charlie Ross.</p>

    <p><b>THE BLUE LAWS ON SMOKING.</b>&mdash;There were some very
    stringent laws in Massachusetts against the use of tobacco in
    public, and while the penalties were not so heavy, yet they
    were apparently rigidly enforced for a time. We quote from a
    law passed in October, 1632, as follows: "It is ordered that
    noe person shall take any tobacco publiquely, under paine of
    punishment; also that every one shall pay 1<i>d.</i> for every
    time hee is convicted of takeing tobacco in any place, and that
    any Assistant shall have power to receave evidence and give
    order for levyeing of it, as also to give order for the
    levyeing of the officer's charge. This order to begin the 10th
    of November next." In September, 1634, we discover another law
    on the same article: "Victualers, or keepers of an Ordinary,
    shall not suffer any tobacco to be taken in their howses, under
    the penalty of 5<i>s.</i> for every offence, to be payde by the
    victuler, and 12<i>d.</i> by the party that takes it. Further,
    it is ordered, that noe person shall take tobacco publiquely,
    under the penalty of 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, nor privately, in
    his owne house, or in the howse of another, before strangers,
    and that two or more shall not take it togeather, anywhere,
    under the aforesaid penalty for every offence." In November,
    1637, the record runs: "All former laws against tobacco are
    repealed, and tobacco is sett at liberty;" but in September,
    1638, "the [General] Court, finding that since the repealing of
    the former laws against tobacco, the same is more abused then
    before, it hath therefore ordered, that no man shall take any
    tobacco in the fields, except in his journey, or at meale
    times, under paine of 12<i>d.</i> for every offence; nor shall
    take any tobacco in (or so near) any dwelling house, barne,
    corne or hay rick, as may likely indanger the fireing thereof,
    upon paine of 10<i>s.</i> for every offence; nor shall take any
    tobacco in any inne or common victualing house, except in a
    private roome there, so as neither the master of the same house
    nor any other guests there shall take offence thereat, which if
    they do, then such person is fourthwith to forbeare, upon paine
    of 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for every offence. Noe man shall
    kindle fyre by gunpowder, for takeing tobacco, except in his
    journey, upon paine of 12<i>d.</i> for every offence."</p>

    <p><b>THE REMARKABLE CAVES&mdash;WYANDOTTE AND
    MAMMOTH.</b>&mdash;Wyandotte Cave is in Jennings township,
    Crawford county, Ind., near the Ohio river. It is a rival of
    the great Mammoth Cave in grandeur and extent. Explorations
    have been made for many miles. It excels the Mammoth Cave in
    the number and variety of its stalagmites and stalactites, and
    in the size of several of its chambers. One of these chambers
    is 350 feet in length, 245 feet in height, and contains a hill
    175 feet high, on which are three fine stalagmites. Epsom
    salts, niter and alum have been obtained from the earth of the
    cave. The Mammoth Cave is in Edmondson county, near Green
    River, about seventy-five miles from Louisville. Its entrance
    is reached by passing down a wild, rocky ravine through a dense
    forest. The cave extends some nine miles. To visit the portions
    already traversed, it is said, requires 150 to 200 miles of
    travel. The cave contains a succession of wonderful avenues,
    chambers, domes, abysses, grottoes, lakes, rivers, cataracts
    and other marvels, which are too well known to need more than a
    reference. One chamber&mdash;the Star&mdash;is about 500 feet
    long, 70 feet wide, 70 feet high, the ceiling of which is
    composed of black gypsum, and is studded with innumerable white
    points, that by a dim light resemble stars, hence the name of
    the chamber. There are avenues one and a half and even two
    miles in length, some of which are incrusted with beautiful
    formations, and present the appearance of enchanted palace
    halls. There is a natural tunnel about three-quarters of a mile
    long, 100 feet wide, covered with a ceiling of smooth rock 45
    feet high. There is a chamber having an area of from four to
    five acres, and there are domes 200 and 300 feet high. Echo
    River is some three-fourths of a mile in length, 200 feet in
    width at some points, and from 10 to 30 in depth, and runs
    beneath an arched ceiling of smooth rock about 15 feet high,
    while the Styx, another river, is 450 feet long, from 15 to 40
    feet wide, and from 30 to 40 feet deep, and is spanned by a
    natural bridge. Lake Lethe has about the same length and width
    as the river Styx, varies in depth from 3 to 40 feet, lies
    beneath a ceiling some 90 feet above its surface, and sometimes
    rises to a height of 60 feet. There is also a Dead Sea, quite a
    somber body of water. There are several interesting caves in
    the neighborhood, one three miles long and three each about a
    mile in length.</p>

    <p><b>THE SOUTH SEA BUBBLE.</b>&mdash;The "South Sea Bubble,"
    as it is generally called, was a financial scheme which
    occupied the attention of prominent politicians, communities,
    and even nations in the early part of the eighteenth century.
    Briefly the facts are: In 1711 Robert Hartley, Earl of Oxford,
    then Lord Treasurer, proposed to fund a floating debt of about
    &pound;10,000,000 sterling, the interest, about $600,000, to be
    secured by rendering permanent the duties upon wines, tobacco,
    wrought silks, etc. Purchasers of this fund were to become also
    shareholders in the "South Sea Company," a corporation to have
    the monopoly of the trade with Spanish South America, a part of
    the capital stock of which was to be the new fund. But Spain,
    after the treaty of Utrecht, refused to open her commerce to
    England, and the privileges of the "South Sea Company" became
    worthless. There were many men of wealth who were stockholders,
    and the company continued to flourish, while the ill success of
    its trading operations was concealed. Even the Spanish War of
    1718 did not shake the popular confidence. Then in April, 1720,
    Parliament, by large majorities in both Houses, accepted the
    company's plan for paying the national debt, and after that a
    frenzy of speculation seized the nation, and the stock rose to
    &pound;300 a share, and by August had reached &pound;1,000 a
    share. Then Sir John Blunt, one of the leaders, sold out,
    others followed, and the stock began to fall. By the close of
    September the company stopped payment and thousands were
    beggared. An investigation ordered by Parliament disclosed much
    fraud and corruption, and many prominent persons were
    implicated, some of the directors were imprisoned, and all of
    them were fined to an aggregate amount of &pound;2,000,000 for
    the benefit of the stockholders. A great part of the valid
    assets was distributed among them, yielding a dividend of about
    33 per cent.</p>

    <p><b>How to Wash Carpets.</b>&mdash;Shake and beat it well;
    lay it upon the floor and tack it firmly; then with a clean
    flannel wash it over with a quart of bullock's gall mixed with
    three quarts of soft, cold water, and rub it off with a clean
    flannel or house-cloth. Any particular dirty spot should be
    rubbed with pure gall.</p>

    <p><b>How to Clean Carpets.</b>&mdash;Before proceeding to
    sweep a carpet a few handfuls of waste tea-leaves should be
    sprinkled over it. A stiff hair broom or brush should be
    employed, unless the carpet is very dirty, when a whisk or
    carpet-broom should be used, first followed by another made of
    hair, to take off the loose dust. The frequent use of a stiff
    carpet-broom soon wears off the beauty of the best carpet. An
    ordinary clothes brush is best adapted for superior carpets.
    When carpets are very dirty they should be cleaned by shaking
    and beating.</p>

    <p>Beat it well with a stick in the usual manner until all the
    dust is removed, then take out the stains, if any, with lemon
    or sorrel-juice. When thoroughly dry rub it all over with the
    crumb of a hot wheaten loaf, and if the weather is very fine,
    let hang out in the open air for a night or two. This treatment
    will revive the colors, and make the carpet appear equal to
    new.</p>

    <p><b>How to Remove Spots on Carpets.</b>&mdash;A few drops of
    carbonate of ammonia, and a small quantity of warm rain water,
    will prove a safe and easy antacid, etc., and will change, if
    carefully applied, discolored spots upon carpets, and indeed,
    all spots, whether produced by acids or alkalies. If one has
    the misfortune to have a carpet injured by whitewash, this will
    immediately restore it.</p>

    <p><b>How to Remove Ink Spots on Carpets.</b>&mdash;As soon as
    the ink has been spilled, take up as much as you can with a
    sponge, and then pour on cold water repeatedly, still taking up
    the liquid; next rub the place with a little wet oxalic acid or
    salt of sorrel, and wash it off immediately with cold water,
    and then rub on some hartshorn.</p>

    <p><b>Cleaning and Scouring of Cloth.</b>&mdash;The common
    method of cleaning cloth is by beating and brushing, unless
    when very dirty, when it undergoes the operation of scouring.
    This is best done on the small scale, as for articles of
    wearing apparel, etc., by dissolving a little curd soap in
    water, and after mixing it with a little ox-gall, to touch over
    all the spots of grease, dirt, etc., with it, and to rub them
    well with a stiff brush, until they are removed, after which
    the article may be well rubbed all over with a brush or sponge
    dipped into some warm water, to which the previous mixture and
    a little more ox-gall has been added. When this has been
    properly done, it only remains to thoroughly rinse the article
    in clean water until the latter passes off uncolored, when it
    must be hung up to dry. For dark, colored cloths the common
    practice is to add some Fuller's-earth to the mixture of soap
    and gall. When nearly dry the nap should be laid right and the
    article carefully pressed, after which a brush, moistened with
    a drop or two of olive oil, is passed several times over it,
    which will give it a superior finish.</p>

    <p>Cloth may also be cleaned in the dry way, as follows: First
    remove the spots, as above, and when the parts have dried,
    strew clean, damp sand over it, and beat it in with a brush,
    after which brush the article with a hard brush when the sand
    will readily come out, and bring the dirt with it. Black cloth
    which is very rusty should receive a coat of reviver after
    drying, and be hung up until the next day, when it may be
    pressed and finished off as before. Scarlet cloth requires
    considerable caution. After being thoroughly rinsed, it should
    be repeatedly passed through cold spring water, to which a
    tablespoonful or two of solution of tin has been added. If much
    faded, it should be dipped in a scarlet dye-bath. Buff cloth is
    generally cleansed by covering it with a paste made with
    pipe-clay and water, which, when dry,-is rubbed and brushed
    off.</p>

    <p><b>Renovation of Cloth.</b>&mdash;The article undergoes the
    process of scouring before described, and, after being well
    rinsed and drained, it is put on a board, and the thread-bare
    parts rubbed with a half-worn hatter's card, filled with
    flocks, or with a teazle or a prickly thistle, until a nap is
    raised. It is next hung up to dry, the nap laid the right way
    with a hard brush, and finished as before. When the cloth is
    much faded, it is usual to give it a dip, as it is called, or
    to pass it through a dye-bath, to freshen up the color.</p>

    <p><b>How to Revive the Color of Black Cloth.</b>&mdash;If a
    coat, clean it well, then boil from two to four ounces of
    logwood in your copper, or boiler, for half an hour; dip your
    coat in warm water, and squeeze it as dry as you can, then put
    it into the copper and boil it for half an hour. Take it out,
    and add a piece of green copperas, about the size of a
    horse-bean; boil it another half hour, then draw it, and hang
    it in the air for an hour or two; take it down; rinse it in two
    or three cold waters; dry it, and let it be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"
       id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span> brushed with a soft brush,
       over which a drop or two of the oil of olives has been
       rubbed, then stroke your coat regularly over.</p>

    <p><b>How to Restore Crape.</b>&mdash;Skimmed milk and water,
    with a little bit of glue in it, made scalding hot, is
    excellent to restore rusty Italian crape. If clapped and pulled
    dry like muslin, it will look as good as new; or, brush the
    veil till all the dust is removed, then fold it lengthwise, and
    roll it smoothly and tightly on a roller. Steam it till it is
    thoroughly dampened, and dry on the roller.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cleanse Feather Beds.</b>&mdash;When feather beds
    become soiled and heavy they may be made clean and light by
    being treated in the following manner: Rub them over with a
    stiff brush, dipped in hot soap-suds. When clean lay them on a
    shed, or any other clean place where the rain will fall on
    them. When thoroughly soaked let them dry in a hot sun for six
    or seven successive days, shaking them up well and turning them
    over each day. They should be covered over with a thick cloth
    during the night; if exposed to the night air they will become
    damp and mildew. This way of washing the bed-ticking and
    feathers makes them very fresh and light, and is much easier
    than the old-fashioned way of emptying the beds and washing the
    feathers separately, while it answers quite as well. Care must
    be taken to dry the bed perfectly before sleeping on it. Hair
    mattresses that have become hard and dirty can be made nearly
    as good as new by ripping them, washing the ticking, and
    picking the hair free from bunches and keeping it in a dry,
    airy place several days. Whenever the ticking gets dry fill it
    lightly with the hair, and tack it together.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cut Up and Cure Pork.</b>&mdash;Have the hog laid
    on his back on a stout, clean bench; cut off the head close to
    the base. If the hog is large, there will come off a
    considerable collar, between head and shoulders, which, pickled
    or dried, is useful for cooking with vegetables. Separate the
    jowl from the face at the natural joint; open the skull
    lengthwise and take out the brains, esteemed a luxury. Then
    with a sharp knife remove the back-bone the whole length, then
    the long strip of fat underlying it, leaving about one inch of
    fat covering the spinal column.</p>

    <p>The leaf lard, if not before taken out for the housewife's
    convenience, is removed, as is also the tenderloin&mdash;a
    fishy-shaped piece of flesh&mdash;often used for sausage, but
    which makes delicious steak. The middling or sides are now cut
    out, leaving the shoulders square-shaped and the hams pointed,
    or they may be rounded to your taste. The spare-ribs are
    usually wholly removed from the sides, with but little meat
    adhering. It is the sides of small, young hogs cured as hams
    that bear the name of breakfast bacon, The sausage meat comes
    chiefly in strips from the backbone, part of which may also be
    used as steak. The lean trimmings from about the joints are
    used for sausage, the fat scraps rendered up with the backbone
    lard.</p>

    <p>The thick part of the backbone that lies between the
    shoulders, called griskin or chine, is separated from the
    tapering, bony part, called backbone by way of distinction, and
    used as flesh. The chines are smoked with jowls, and used in
    late winter or spring.</p>

    <p>When your meat is to be pickled it should be dusted lightly
    with saltpetre sprinkled with salt, and allowed to drain
    twenty-four hours; then plunge it into pickle, and keep under
    with a weight. It is good policy to pickle a portion of the
    sides. They, after soaking, are sweeter to cook with
    vegetables, and the grease fried from them is much more useful
    than that of smoked meat.</p>

    <p>If your meat is to be dry salted, allow one teaspoonful of
    pulverized saltpetre to one gallon of salt, and keep the
    mixture warm beside you. Put on a hog's ear as a mitten, and
    rub each piece of meat thoroughly. Then pack skin side down,
    ham upon ham, side upon side, strewing on salt abundantly. It
    is best to put large and small pieces in different boxes for
    the convenience of getting at them to hang up at the different
    times they will come into readiness. The weather has so much to
    do with the time that meat requires to take salt that no
    particular time can be specified for leaving it in.</p>

    <p>The best test is to try a medium-sized ham; if salt enough,
    all similar and smaller pieces are surely ready, and it is well
    to remember that the saltness increases in drying. Ribs and
    steaks should be kept in a cold, dark place, without salting,
    until ready for use. If you have many, or the weather is warm,
    they keep better in pickle than dry salt. Many persons turn and
    rub their meat frequently. We have never practiced this, and
    have never lost any.</p>

    <p>When the meat is ready for smoking, dip the hocks of the
    joints in ground black pepper and dust the raw surface thickly
    with it. Sacks, after this treatment, may be used for double
    security, and I think bacon high and dry is sweeter than packed
    in any substance. For sugar-cured hams we append the best
    recipe we have ever used, though troublesome.</p>

    <p><i>English Recipe for Sugar-Curing Hams</i>.&mdash;So soon
    as the meat comes from the butcher's hand rub it thoroughly
    with the salt. Repeat this four days, keeping the meat where it
    can drain. The fourth day rub it with saltpetre and a handful
    of common salt, allowing one pound of saltpetre to seventy
    pounds of meat. Now mix one pound of brown sugar and one of
    molasses, rub over the ham every day for a fortnight, and then
    smoke with hickory chips or cobs. Hams should be hung highest
    in meat-houses, because there they are less liable to the
    attacks of insects, for insects do not so much infest high
    places&mdash;unlike human pests.</p>

    <p><i>Pickle</i>.&mdash;Make eight gallons of brine strong
    enough to float an egg; add two pounds of brown sugar or a
    quart of molasses, and four ounces of saltpetre; boil and skim
    clean, and pour cold on your meat. Meat intended for smoking
    should remain in pickle about four weeks. This pickle can be
    boiled over, and with a fresh cup of sugar and salt used all
    summer. Some persons use as much soda as saltpetre. It will
    correct acidity, but we think impairs the meat.</p>

    <p><b>Washing Preparation.</b>&mdash;Take a 1/4 of a pound of
    soap, a 1/4 of a pound of soda, and a 1/4 of a pound of
    quicklime. Cut up the soup and dissolve it in 1 quart of
    boiling water; pour 1 quart of boiling water over the soda, and
    3 quarts of boiling water upon the quicklime. The lime must be
    quick and fresh; if it is good it will bubble up on pouring the
    hot water upon it. Each must be prepared in separate vessels.
    The lime must settle so as to leave the water on the top
    perfectly clear; then strain it carefully (not disturbing the
    settlings) into the washboiler with the soda and soap; let it
    scald long enough to dissolve the soap, then add 6 gallons of
    soap water. The clothes must be put to soak over night, after
    rubbing soap upon the dirtiest parts of them. After having the
    above in readiness, wring out the clothes which have been put
    in soak, put them on to boil, and let each lot boil half an
    hour; the same water will answer for the whole washing. After
    boiling each lot half an hour drain them from the boiling water
    put them in a tub and pour upon them two or three pailsful of
    clear, hot water; after this they will want very little
    rubbing; then rinse through two waters, blueing the last. When
    dried they will be a beautiful white. After washing the
    cleanest part of the white clothes, take two pails of the suds
    in which they have been washed, put it over the fire and scald,
    and this will wash all the flannels and colored clothes without
    any extra soap. The white flannels, after being well washed in
    the suds, will require to be scalded by turning on a teakettle
    of boiling water.</p>

    <h2>HOW TO DESTROY HOUSEHOLD PESTS</h2>

    <p><b>How to Destroy Ants.</b>&mdash;Ants that frequent houses
    or gardens may he destroyed by taking flower of brimstone half
    a pound and potash four ounces; set them in an iron or earthen
    pan over the fire till dissolved and united; afterward beat
    them to a powder, and infuse a little of this powder in water;
    and wherever you sprinkle it the ants will die or fly the
    place.</p>

    <p><b>How to Destroy Black Ants.</b>&mdash;A few leaves of
    green wormwood, scattered among the haunts of these troublesome
    insects, is said to be effectual in dislodging them.</p>

    <p><b>How to Destroy Red Ants.</b>&mdash;The best way to get
    rid of ants, is to set a quantity of cracked walnuts or
    shell-barks on plates, and put them in the closet or places
    where the ants congregate. They are very fond of these, and
    will collect on them in myriads. When they have collected on
    them make a general <i>auto-da-fe</i>, by turning nuts and ants
    together into the fire, and then replenish the plates with
    fresh nuts. After they have become so thinned off as to cease
    collecting on plates, powder some camphor and put in the holes
    and crevices, whereupon the remainder of them will speedily
    depart. It may help the process of getting them to assemble on
    shell-barks, to remove all edibles out of their way for the
    time.</p>

    <p><b>How to Destroy Black Bees.</b>&mdash;Place two or three
    shallow vessels&mdash;the larger kind of flower-pot saucers
    will do&mdash;half filled with water, on the floors where they
    assemble, with strips of cardboard running from the edge of the
    vessel to the floor, at a gentle inclination; these the
    unwelcome guests will eagerly ascend, and so find a watery
    grave.</p>

    <p><b>How to Destroy Bed-Bugs.</b>&mdash;1. When they have made
    a lodgement in the wall, fill all the apertures with a mixture
    of soft soap and Scotch snuff. Take the bedstead to pieces, and
    treat that in the same way. 2. A strong decoction of red pepper
    applied to bedsteads will either kill the bugs or drive them
    away. 3. Put the bedstead into a close room and set fire to the
    following composition, placed in an iron pot upon the hearth,
    having previously closed up the chimney, then shut the door,
    let them remain a day: Sulphur nine parts; saltpetre, powdered,
    one part. Mix. Be sure to open the door of the room five or six
    hours before you venture to go into it a second time. 4. Rub
    the bedstead well with lampoil; this alone is good, but to make
    it more effectual, get ten cents worth of quicksilver and add
    to it. Put it into all the cracks around the bed, and they will
    soon disappear. The bedsteads should first be scalded and wiped
    dry, then put on with a feather. 5. Corrosive sublimate, one
    ounce; muriatic acid, two ounces; water, four ounces; dissolve,
    then add turpentine, one pint; decoction of tobacco, one pint.
    Mix. For the decoction of tobacco boil one ounce of tobacco in
    a 1/2 pint of water. The mixture must be applied with a paint
    brush. This wash is deadly poison. 6. Rub the bedsteads in the
    joints with equal parts of spirits of turpentine and kerosene
    oil, and the cracks of the surbase in rooms where there are
    many. Filling up all the cracks with hard soap is an excellent
    remedy.</p>

    <p>March and April are the months when bedsteads should be
    examined to kill all the eggs. 7. Mix together two ounces
    spirits of turpentine, one ounce corrosive sublimate, and one
    pint alcohol. 8. Distilled vinegar, or diluted good vinegar, a
    pint; camphor one-half ounce; dissolve. 9. White arsenic, two
    ounces; lard, thirteen ounces; corrosive sublimate, one-fourth
    ounce; venetian red, one-fourth ounce. (Deadly poison.) 10.
    Strong mercurial ointment one ounce; soft soap one ounce; oil
    of turpentine, a pint 11. Gasoline and coaloil are both
    excellent adjuncts, with cleanliness, in ridding a bed or house
    of these pests.</p>

    <p><b>How to Destroy Caterpillars.</b>&mdash;Boil together a
    quantity of rue, wormwood, and any cheap tobacco (equal parts)
    in common water. The liquid should be very strong. Sprinkle it
    on the leaves and young branches every morning and evening
    during the time the fruit is ripening.</p>

    <p><b>How to Destroy Cockroaches and Beetles.</b>&mdash;1.
    Strew the roots of black hellebore, at night, in the places
    infested by these vermin, and they will be found in the morning
    dead or dying. Black hellebore grows in marshy grounds, and may
    be had at the herb shops. 2. Put about a quart of water
    sweetened with molasses in a tin wash basin or smooth glazed
    china bowl. Set it at evening in a place frequented by the
    bugs. Around the basin put an old piece of carpet that the bugs
    can have easy access to the top. They will go down in the
    water, and stay till you come. 3. Take pulverized borax, 4
    parts, flour 1 part, mix intimately and distribute the mixture
    in cupboards which are frequented by the roaches, or blow it,
    by means of a bellows, into the holes or cracks that are
    infested by them. 4. By scattering a handful of fresh cucumber
    parings about the house. 5. Take carbonic acid and powdered
    camphor in equal parts; put them in a bottle; they will become
    fluid. With a painter's brush of the size called a sash-tool,
    put the mixture on the cracks or places where the roaches hide;
    they will come out at once. Then kill. 6. Mix up a quantity of
    fresh burned plaster of paris (gypsum, such as is used for
    making molds and ornaments), with wheat flour and a little
    sugar, and distribute on shallow plates and box boards, and
    place in the corners of the kitchen and pantry where they
    frequent. In the darkness they will feast themselves on it.
    Whether it interferes with their digestion or not, is difficult
    to ascertain, but after three or four nights renewal of the
    preparation, no cockroaches will be found on the premises.</p>

    <p><b>How to Destroy Crickets.</b>&mdash;Sprinkle a little
    quick lime near to the cracks through which they enter the
    room. The lime may be laid down overnight, and swept away in
    the morning. In a few days they will most likely all be
    destroyed. But care must be taken that the children do not
    meddle with the lime, as a very small portion of it getting
    into the eye, would prove exceedingly hurtful. In case of such
    an accident the best thing to do would be to wash the eye with
    vinegar and water.</p>

    <p><b>How to get Rid of Fleas.</b>&mdash;Much of the largest
    number of fleas are brought into our family circles by pet dogs
    and cats. The oil of pennyroyal will drive these insects off:
    but a cheaper method, where the herb flourishes, is to throw
    your cats and dogs into a decoction of it once a week. When the
    herb cannot be got, the oil can be procured. In this case,
    saturate strings with it and tie them around the necks of the
    dogs and cats. These applications should be repeated every
    twelve or fifteen days. Mint
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"
       id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span> freshly cut, and hung round a
       bedstead, or on the furniture, will prevent annoyance from
       bed insects; a few drops of essential oil of lavender will
       be more efficacious.</p>

    <p><b>How to Destroy Flies.</b>&mdash;1. Take an infusion of
    quassia, one pint; brown sugar, four ounces, ground pepper, two
    ounces. To be well mixed together, and put in small shallow
    dishes where required. 2. Black pepper (powdered), one drachm;
    brown sugar, one drachm; milk or cream, two drachms. Mix, and
    place it on a plate or saucer where the flies are most
    troublesome. 3. Pour a little simple oxymel (an article to be
    obtained at the druggists), into a common tumbler glass, and
    place in the glass a piece of cap paper, made into the shape of
    the upper part of a funnel, with a hole at the bottom to admit
    the flies. Attracted by the smell, they readily enter the trap
    in swarms, and by the thousands soon collected prove that they
    have not the wit or the disposition to return. 4. Take some
    jars, mugs, or tumblers, fill them half full with soapy water;
    cover them as jam-pots are covered, with a piece of paper,
    either tied down or tucked under the rim. Let this paper be
    rubbed inside with wet sugar, molasses, honey, or jam, or any
    thing sweet; cut a small hole in the center, large enough for a
    fly to enter. The flies settle on the top, attracted by the
    smell of the bait; they then crawl through the hole, to feed
    upon the sweets beneath. Meanwhile the warmth of the weather
    causes the soapy water to ferment, and produces a gas which
    overpowers the flies, and they drop down into the vessel.
    Thousands may be destroyed this way, and the traps last a long
    time.</p>

    <p><b>Fly Paper.</b>&mdash;Melt resin, and add thereto while
    soft, sufficient sweet oil, lard, or lamp oil to make it, when
    cold about the consistency of honey. Spread on writing paper,
    and place in a convenient spot. It will soon be filled with
    ants, Hies, and other vermin.</p>

    <p><b>How to Expel Insects.</b>&mdash;All insects dread
    pennyroyal: the smell of it destroys some, and drives others
    away. At the time that fresh pennyroyal cannot be gathered, get
    oil of pennyroyal; pour some into a saucer, and steep in it
    small pieces of wadding or raw cotton, and place them in
    corners, closet-shelves, bureau drawers, boxes, etc., and the
    cockroaches, ants, or other insects will soon disappear. It is
    also well to place some between the mattresses, and around the
    bed. It is also a splendid thing for brushing off that terrible
    little insect, the seed tick.</p>

    <p><b>How to Destroy Mice.</b>&mdash;1. Use tartar emetic
    mingled with some favorite food. The mice will leave the
    premises. 2. Take one part calomel, five parts of wheat flour,
    one part sugar, and one-tenth of a part of ultramarine. Mix
    together in a fine powder and place it in a dish. This is a
    most efficient poison for mice.</p>

    <p>3. Any one desirous of keeping seeds from the depredations
    of mice can do so by mixing pieces of camphor gum in with the
    seeds. Camphor placed in drawers or trunks will prevent mice
    from doing them injury. The little animal objects to the odor
    and keeps a good distance from it. He will seek food
    elsewhere.</p>

    <p>4. Gather all kinds of mint and scatter about your shelves,
    and they will forsake the premises.</p>

    <p><b>How to Drive Away Mosquitoes.</b>&mdash;1. A camphor bag
    hung up in an open casement will prove an effectual barrier to
    their entrance. Camphorated spirits applied as perfume to the
    face and hands will prove an effectual preventive; but when
    bitten by them, aromatic vinegar is the beat antidote.</p>

    <p>2. A small amount of oil of pennyroyal sprinkled around the
    room will drive away the mosquitoes. This is an excellent
    recipe.</p>

    <p>3. Take of gum camphor a piece about half the size of an
    egg, and evaporate it by placing it in a tin vessel and holding
    it over a lamp or candle, taking care that it does not ignite.
    The smoke will soon fill the room and expel the mosquitoes.</p>

    <p><b>How to Preserve Clothing from Moths.</b>&mdash;1. Procure
    shavings of cedar wood and enclose in muslin bags, which should
    be distributed freely among clothes. 2. Procure shavings of
    camphor wood, and enclose in bags. 3. Sprinkle pimento
    (allspice) berries among the clothes. 4. Sprinkle the clothes
    with the seeds of the musk plant. 5. An ounce of gum camphor
    and one of the powdered shell of red pepper are macerated in
    eight ounces of strong alcohol for several days, then strained.
    With this tincture the furs or cloths are sprinkled over, and
    rolled up in sheets. 6. Carefully shake and brush woolens early
    in the spring, so as to be certain that no eggs are in them;
    then sew them up in cotton or linen wrappers, putting a piece
    of camphor gum, tied up in a bit of muslin, into each bundle,
    or into the chests and closets where the articles are to lie.
    No moth will approach while the smell of the camphor continues.
    When the gum is evaporated, it must be renewed. Enclose them in
    a moth-proof box with camphor, no matter whether made of white
    paper or white pine, before any eggs are laid on them by early
    spring moths. The notion of having a trunk made of some
    particular kind of wood for this purpose, is nonsense. Furs or
    woolens, put away in spring time, before moth eggs are laid,
    into boxes, trunks, drawers, or closets even, where moths
    cannot enter, will be safe from the ravages of moth-worms,
    provided none were in them that were laid late in the autumn,
    for they are not of spontaneous production.</p>

    <p><b>How to Kill Moths in Carpets.</b>&mdash;Wring a coarse
    crash towel out of clear water, spread it smoothly on the
    carpet, iron it dry with a good hot iron, repeating the
    operation on all parts of the carpet suspected of being
    infected with moths. No need to press hard, and neither the
    pile nor color of the carpet will he injured, and the moths
    will be destroyed by the heat and steam.</p>

    <p><b>How to Destroy Rats.</b>&mdash;1. When a house is
    invested with rats which refuse to be caught by cheese and
    other baits, a few drops of the highly-scented oil of rhodium
    poured on the bottom of the cage will be an attraction which
    they cannot refuse. 2. Place on the floor near where their
    holes are supposed to be a thin layer of moist caustic potash.
    When the rats travel on this, it will cause their feet to
    become sore, which they lick, and their tongues become likewise
    sore. The consequence is, that they shun this locality, and
    seem to inform all the neighboring rats about it, and the
    result is that they soon abandon a house that has such mean
    floors. 3. Cut some corks as thin as wafers, and fry, roast, or
    stew them in grease, and place the same in their track; or a
    dried sponge fried or dipped in molasses or honey, with a small
    quantity of bird lime or oil of rhodium, will fasten to their
    fur and cause them to depart. 4. If a live rat can be caught
    and smeared over with tar or train oil, and afterwards allowed
    to escape in the holes of other rats, he will cause all soon to
    take their departure. 5. If a live rat be caught, and a small
    bell be fastened around his neck, and allowed to escape, all of
    his brother rats as well as himself will very soon go to some
    other neighbor's house. 6. Take a pan, about twelve inches
    deep, and half fill it with water; then sprinkle some bran on
    the water and set the pan in a place where the rats most
    frequent. In the morning you will find several rats in the pan.
    7. Flour, three parts; sugar, one-half part; sulphur, two
    parts, and phosphorus, two parts. Smear on meat, and place near
    where the rats are most troublesome. 8. Squills are an
    excellent poison for rats. The powder should be mixed with some
    fatty substance, and spread upon slices of bread. The pulp of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"
       id="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span> is also very good. Rats are
       very fond of either. 9. Take two ounces of carbonate of
       barytes, and mix with one pound of suet or tallow, place a
       portion of this within their holes and about their haunts.
       It is greedily eaten, produces great thirst, and death
       ensues after drinking. This is a very effectual poison,
       because it is both tasteless and odorless. 10. Take one
       ounce of finely powdered arsenic, one ounce of lard; mix
       these into a paste with meal, put it about the haunts of
       rats. They will eat of it greedily. 11. Make a paste of one
       ounce of flour, one-half gill of water, one drachm of
       phosphorus, and one ounce of flour. Or, one ounce of flour,
       two ounces of powdered cheese crumbs, and one-half drachm of
       phosphorus; add to each of these mixtures a few drops of the
       oil of rhodium, and spread this on thin pieces of bread like
       butter; the rats will eat of this greedily, and it is a sure
       poison. 12. Mix some ground plaster of paris with some sugar
       and Indian meal. Set it about on plates, and leave beside
       each plate a saucer of water. When the rats have eaten the
       mixture they will drink the water and die. To attract them
       toward it, you may sprinkle on the edges of the plates a
       little of the oil of rhodium. Another method of getting rid
       of rats is, to strew pounded potash on their holes. The
       potash gets into their coats and irritates the skin, and the
       rats desert the place. 13. The Dutch method: this is said to
       be used successfully in Holland; we have, however, never
       tried it. A number of rats are left together to themselves
       in a very large trap or cage, with no food whatever; their
       craving hunger will, at last, cause them to fight and the
       weakest will be eaten by the others; after a short time the
       fight is renewed, and the next weakest is the victim, and so
       it goes on till one strong rat is left. When this one has
       eaten the last remains of any of the others, it is set
       loose; the animal has now acquired such a taste for
       rat-flesh that he is the terror of ratdom, going round
       seeking what rat he may devour. In an incredibly short time
       the premises are abandoned by all other rats, which will not
       come back before the cannibal rat has left or has died. 14.
       Catch a rat and smear him over with a mixture of phosphorus
       and lard, and then let him loose. The house will soon be
       emptied of these pests.</p>

    <p><b>Vermin, in Water.</b>&mdash;Go to the river or pond, and
    with a small net (a piece of old mosquito bar will do) collect
    a dozen or more of the small fishes known as minnows, and put
    them in your cistern, and in a short time you will have clear
    water, the wiggle-tails and reddish-colored bugs or lice being
    gobbled up by the fishes.</p>

    <h2>ACCIDENTS AND INJURIES</h2>

    <h3 style="margin-top:0em">And How to Meet Them</h3>

    <p>As accidents are constantly liable to occur, the importance
    of knowing how best to meet the various emergencies that may
    arise can hardly be over-estimated. In all cases, and under all
    circumstances, the best help to assist a party in this trying
    moment is <i>presence of mind</i>.</p>

    <p><b>Harvest Bug-Bites.</b>&mdash;The best remedy is the use
    of benzine, which immediately kills the insect. A small drop of
    tincture of iodine has the same effect.</p>

    <p><b>Bites and Stings of Insects.</b>&mdash;Such as bees,
    wasps, hornets, etc., although generally painful, and ofttimes
    causing much disturbance, yet are rarely attended with fatal
    results. The pain and swelling may generally be promptly
    arrested by bathing freely with a strong solution of equal
    parts of common salt and baking soda, in warm water; or by the
    application of spirits of hartshorn; or of volatile liniment
    (one part of spirits of hartshorn and two of olive oil). In the
    absence of the other articles, warm oil may be used; or, if
    this is not at hand, apply a paste made from fresh clay-earth.
    If the sting of the insect is left in the wound, as is
    frequently the case, it should always be extracted. If there is
    faintness, give some stimulant; as, a tablespoonful or two of
    brandy and water, or brandy and ammonia.</p>

    <p><b>Mad Dog Bites.</b>&mdash;1. Take immediately warm vinegar
    or tepid water; wash the wound clean therewith and then dry it;
    pour upon the wound, then, ten or twelve drops of muriatic
    acid. Mineral acids destroy the poison of the saliva, by which
    means the evil effects of the latter are neutralized. 2. Many
    think that the only sure preventive of evil following the bite
    of a rabid dog is to suck the wound immediately, before the
    poison has had time to circulate with the blood. If the person
    bit cannot get to the wound to suck it, he must persuade or pay
    another to do it for him. There is no fear of any harm
    following this, for the poison entering by the stomach cannot
    hurt a person. A spoonful of the poison might be swallowed with
    impunity, but the person who sucks the place should have no
    wound on the lip or tongue, or it might be dangerous. The
    precaution alluded to is a most important one, and should never
    be omitted prior to an excision and the application of lunar
    caustic in every part, especially the interior and deep-seated
    portions. No injury need be anticipated if this treatment is
    adopted promptly and effectively. The poison of hydrophobia
    remains latent on an average six weeks; the part heals over,
    but there is a pimple or wound, more or less irritable; it then
    becomes painful; and the germ, whatever it is, ripe for
    dissemination into the system, and then all hope is gone.
    Nevertheless, between the time of the bite and the activity of
    the wound previous to dissemination, the caustic of nitrate of
    silver is a sure preventive; after that it is as useless as all
    the other means. The best mode of application of the nitrate of
    silver is by introducing it solidly into the wound.</p>

    <p><b>Serpents Bites.</b>&mdash;The poison inserted by the
    stings and bites of many venomous reptiles is so rapidly
    absorbed, and of so fatal a description, as frequently to
    occasion death before any remedy or antidote can be applied;
    and they are rendered yet more dangerous from the fact that
    these wounds are inflicted in parts of the country and world
    where precautionary measures are seldom thought of, and
    generally at times when people are least prepared to meet them.
    1. In absence of any remedies, the first best plan to adopt on
    being bitten by any of the poisonous snakes is to do as
    recommended above in Mad Dog Bites&mdash;viz., to wash off the
    place immediately; if possible get the mouth to the spot, and
    forcibly suck out all the poison, first applying a ligature
    above the wound as tightly as can be borne. 2. A remedy
    promulgated by the Smithsonian Institute is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"
       id="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span> 30 grs. iodide potassium, 30
       grs. iodine, 1 oz. water, to be applied externally to the
       wound by saturating lint or batting&mdash;the same to be
       kept moist with the antidote until the cure be effected,
       which will be in one hour, and sometimes instantly. 3. An
       Australian physician has tried and recommends carbolic acid,
       diluted and administered internally every few minutes until
       recovery is certain. 4. Another Australian physician,
       Professor Halford, of Melbourne University, has discovered
       that if a proper amount of dilute ammonia be injected into
       the circulation of a patient suffering from snake-bite, the
       curative effect is usually sudden and startling, so that, in
       many cases, men have thus been brought back, as it were, by
       magic, from the very shadow of death.</p>

    <p><b>Bleeding at the Nose.</b>&mdash;1. Roll up a piece of
    paper, and press it under the upper lip. 2. In obstinate cases
    blow a little gum Arabic up the nostrils through a quill, which
    will immediately stop the discharge; powdered alum is also
    good. 3. Pressure by the finger over the small artery near the
    ala (wing) of the nose, on the side where the blood is flowing,
    is said to arrest the hemorrhage immediately.</p>

    <p><b>Bleeding from the Lungs.</b>&mdash;A New York physician
    has related a case in which inhalation of very dry persulphate
    of iron, reduced to a palpable powder, entirely arrested
    bleeding from the lungs, after all the usual remedies, lead,
    opium, etc., had failed. A small quantity was administered by
    drawing into the lungs every hour during part of the night and
    following day.</p>

    <p><b>Bleeding from the Bowels.</b>&mdash;The most common cause
    of this, when not a complication of some disease, is
    hemorrhoids or piles. Should serious hemorrhage occur, rest and
    quiet, and cold water poured slowly over the lower portion of
    the belly, or cloths wet with cold water, or better, with ice
    water applied over the belly and thighs, and to the lower end
    of the bowels, will ordinarily arrest it. In some cases it may
    be necessary to use injections of cold water, or even put small
    pieces of ice in the rectum.</p>

    <p><b>Bleeding from the Mouth.</b>&mdash;This is generally
    caused by some injury to the cheeks, gums or tongue, but it
    sometimes occurs without any direct cause of this kind, and no
    small alarm may be caused by mistaking it for bleeding from the
    lungs. Except when an artery of some size is injured, bleeding
    from the mouth can generally be controlled by gargling and
    washing the mouth with cold water, salt and water, or alum and
    water, or some persulphate of iron may be applied to the
    bleeding surface. Sometimes obstinate or even alarming bleeding
    may follow the pulling of a tooth. The best remedy for this is
    to plug the cavity with lint or cotton wet with the solution of
    persulphate of iron, and apply a compress which may be kept in
    place by closing the teeth on it.</p>

    <p><b>Bleeding from the Stomach.</b>&mdash;<i>Vomiting
    blood</i>.&mdash;Hemorrhage from the stomach is seldom so
    serious as to endanger life; but as it may be a symptom of some
    dangerous affection, it is always best to consult a physician
    concerning it. In the meantime, as in all other varieties of
    hemorrhage, perfect quiet should be preserved. A little salt,
    or vinegar, or lemon juice, should be taken at intervals, in a
    small glass of fresh cool water, or ice-water, as ice may be
    swallowed in small pieces, and cloths wet with ice-water, or
    pounded ice applied over the stomach.</p>

    <p><b>Bleeding from Varicose Veins.</b>&mdash;Serious and even
    fatal hemorrhage may occur from the bursting of a large
    varicose or "broken" vein. Should such an accident occur, the
    bleeding may be best controlled, until proper medical aid can
    be procured, by a tight bandage; or a "stick tourniquet,"
    remembering that the blood comes toward the heart in the veins,
    and from it in the arteries. The best thing to prevent the
    rupture of varicose or broken veins is to support the limb by
    wearing elastic stockings, or a carefully applied bandage.</p>

    <p><b>Burns and Scalds.</b>&mdash;There is no class of
    accidents that cause such an amount of agony, and none which
    are followed with more disastrous results.</p>

    <p>1. By putting the burned part under cold water, milk, or
    other bland fluid, instantaneous and perfect relief from all
    pain will be experienced. On withdrawal, the burn should be
    perfectly covered with half an inch or more of common wheaten
    flour, put on with a dredging-box, or in any other way, and
    allowed to remain until a cure is effected, when the dry, caked
    flour will fall off, or can be softened with water, disclosing
    a beautiful, new and healthy skin, in all cases where the burns
    have been superficial. 2. Dissolve white lead in flaxseed oil
    to the consistency of milk, and apply over the entire burn or
    scald every five minutes. It can be applied with a soft
    feather. This is said to give relief sooner, and to be more
    permanent in its effects, than any other application. 3. Make a
    saturated solution of alum (four ounces to a quart of hot
    water). Dip a cotton cloth in this solution and apply
    immediately on the burn. As soon as it becomes hot or dry,
    replace it by another, and continue doing so as often as the
    cloth dries, which at first will be every few minutes. The pain
    will immediately cease, and after twenty-four hours of this
    treatment the burn will be healed; especially if commenced
    before blisters are formed. The astringent and drying qualities
    of the alum will entirely prevent their formation. 4.
    Glycerine, five ounces; white of egg, four ounces; tincture of
    arnica, three ounces. Mix the glycerine and white of egg
    thoroughly in a mortar, and gradually add the arnica. Apply
    freely on linen rags night, and morning, washing previously
    with warm castile soap-suds. 5. Take one drachm of finely
    powdered alum, and mix thoroughly with the white of two eggs
    and one teacup of fresh lard; spread on a cloth, and apply to
    the parts burnt. It gives almost instant relief from pain, and,
    by excluding the air, prevents excessive inflammatory action.
    The application should be changed at least once a day. 6. M.
    Joel, of the Children's Hospital, Lausanne, finds that a tepid
    bath, containing a couple of pinches of sulphate of iron, gives
    immediate relief to young children who have been extensively
    burned. In a case of a child four years old, a bath repeated
    twice a day&mdash;twenty minutes each bath&mdash;the
    suppuration decreased, lost its odor, and the little sufferer
    was soon convalescent. 7. For severe scalding, carbolic acid
    has recently been used with marked benefit. It is to be mixed
    with thirty parts of the ordinary oil of lime water to one part
    of the acid. Linen rags satured in the carbolic emulsion are to
    be spread on the scalded parts, and kept moist by frequently
    smearing with the feather dipped in the liquid. Two advantages
    of this mode of treatment are, the exclusion of air, and the
    rapid healing by a natural restorative action without the
    formation of pus, thus preserving unmarred and personal
    appearance of the patient&mdash;a matter of no small importance
    to some people.</p>

    <p><b>Choking.</b>&mdash;In case of Choking, a violent slap
    with the open hand between the shoulders of the sufferer will
    often effect a dislodgment. In case the accident occurs with a
    child, and the slapping process does not afford instant relief,
    it should be grasped by the feet, and placed head downwards,
    and the slapping between the shoulders renewed; but in case
    this induced violent suffocative paroxysms it must not be
    repeated. If the substance, whatever it maybe, has entered the
    windpipe, and the coughing and inverting the body fails to
    dislodge it, it is probable that nothing but cutting open the
    windpipe will be of any <span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"
       id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span> and for this the services of
       a surgeon should always be procured. If food has stuck in
       the throat or gullet, the forefinger should be immediately
       introduced; and if lodged at the entrance of the gullet, the
       substance may be reached and extracted, possibly, with the
       forefinger alone, or may be seized with a pair of pincers,
       if at hand, or a curling tongs, or anything of the kind.
       This procedure may be facilitated by directing the person to
       put the tongue well out, in which position it may be
       retained by the individual himself, or a bystander by
       grasping it, covered with a handkerchief or towel. Should
       this fail, an effort should be made to excite retching or
       vomiting by passing the finger to the root of the tongue, in
       hopes that the offending substance may in this way be
       dislodged; or it may possibly be effected by suddenly and
       unexpectedly dashing in the face a basin of cold water, the
       shock suddenly relaxing the muscular spasm present, and the
       involuntary gasp at the same time may move it up or down. If
       this cannot be done, as each instant's delay is of vital
       importance to a choking man, seize a fork, a spoon, a
       penholder, pencil, quill, or anything suitable at hand, and
       endeavor to push the article down the throat. If it be low
       down the gullet, and other means fail, its dislodgment may
       sometimes be effected by dashing cold water on the spine, or
       vomiting may be induced by an emetic of sulphate of zinc
       (twenty grains in a couple of tablespoonfuls of warm water),
       or of common salt and mustard in like manner, or it may be
       pushed into the stomach by extemporizing a probang, by
       fastening a small sponge to the end of a stiff strip of
       whalebone. If this cannot he done, a surgical operation will
       be necessary. Fish bones or other sharp substances, when
       they cannot be removed by the finger or forceps, may
       sometimes be dislodged by swallowing some pulpy mass, as
       masticated bread, etc. Irregularly shaped substances, a
       plate with artificial teeth for instance, can ordinarily be
       removed only by surgical interference.</p>

    <p><b>Colic.</b>&mdash;Use a hot fomentation over the abdomen,
    and a small quantity of ginger, pepermint or common tea. If not
    relieved in a few minutes, then give an injection of a quart of
    warm water with twenty or thirty drops of laudanum, and repeat
    it if necessary. A half teaspoonful of chloroform, in a
    tablespoonful of sweetened water, with or without a few drops
    of spirits of lavender or essence of peppermint, will often
    give prompt relief.</p>

    <p><b>Convulsions.</b>&mdash;In small children convulsions
    frequently happen from teething, sometimes from worms or from
    some irritating substance within the stomach or bowels, and
    sometimes from some affection of the brain.</p>

    <p>When a child has convulsions, place it immediately in a warm
    or hot bath, and sponge its head with cold water. Then apply a
    hot mustard plaster to the wrists, ankles and soles of the
    feet, or, in case a plaster cannot be obtained, apply a cloth
    wrung out of hot mustard water. Allow these to remain until the
    skin reddens, and use care that the same do not blister. After
    the fit has subsided, use great care against its return by
    attention to the cause which gave rise to it.</p>

    <p>Convulsions in adults must be treated in accordance with the
    manner which gave rise to them. During the attack great care
    should be taken that the party does not injure himself, and the
    best preventive is a cork or a soft piece of wood, or other
    suitable substance, placed between the teeth to prevent biting
    the tongue and cheeks: tight clothing must be removed or
    loosened; mustard poultices should be applied to the
    extremities and over the abdomen; abundance of fresh air should
    be secured by opening windows and doors, and preventing
    unnecessary crowding of persons around; cold water may be
    dashed on the face and chest; and if there be plethora, with
    full bounding pulse, with evidence of cerebral or other
    internal congestion, the abstraction of a few ounces of blood
    may be beneficial.</p>

    <p><b>Cramp.</b>&mdash;Spasmodic or involuntary contractions of
    the muscles generally of the extremities, accompanied with
    great pain. The muscles of the legs and feet are the most
    commonly affected with cramp, especially after great exertion.
    The best treatment is immediately to stand upright, and to well
    rub the part with the hand. The application of strong
    stimulants, as spirits of ammonia, or of anodines, as opiate
    liniments, has been recommended. When cramp occurs in the
    stomach, a teaspoonful of sal volatile in water, or a dram
    glassful of good brandy, should be swallowed immediately. When
    cramp comes on during cold bathing, the limb should be thrown
    out as suddenly and violently as possible, which will generally
    remove it, care being also taken not to become flurried nor
    frightened, as presence of mind is very essential to personal
    safety on such an occasion. A common cause of cramp is
    indigestion, and the use of acescent liquors; these should be
    avoided.</p>

    <p><b>Cuts.</b>&mdash;In case the flow of blood is trifling,
    stop the bleeding by bringing the edges of the wound together,
    If the flow of blood is great, of a bright vermillion color,
    and flows in spurts or with a jerk, an artery is severed, and
    at once should pressure be made on the parts by the finger
    (between the cut and the heart), until a compress is arranged
    by a tight ligature above the wounded part. Then the finger may
    be taken off, and if the blood still flows, tighten the
    handkerchief or other article that forms the ligature, until it
    ceases. If at this point the attendance of a physician or
    surgeon cannot be secured, take strong silk thread, or wax
    together three or four threads and cut them into lengths of
    about a foot long. Wash the parts with warm water, and then
    with a sharp hook or small pair of pincers in your hand, fix
    your eye steadfastly upon the wound, and directing the ligature
    to be slightly released, you will see the mouth of the artery
    from which the blood springs. At once seize it, draw it out a
    little while an assistant passes a ligature round it, and ties
    it up tight with a double knot. In this way take up in
    succession every bleeding vessel you can see or get hold of. If
    the wound is too high up in a limb to apply the ligature do not
    lose your presence of mind. If it is the thigh, press firmly on
    the groin; if in the arm, with the band-end or ring of a common
    door-key make pressure above the collar bone, and about its
    middle, against its first rib, which lies under it. The
    pressure should be continued until assistance is procured and
    the vessel tied up. If the wound is on the face, or other place
    where pressure cannot effectually be made, place a piece of ice
    directly over the wound allowing it to remain there until the
    blood coagulates, when it may be removed, and a compress and
    bandage be applied.</p>

    <p>After the bleeding is arrested the surrounding blood should
    be cleared away, as well as any extraneous matter then bring
    the sides of the wound into contact throughout the whole depth,
    in order that they may grow together as quickly as possible,
    retaining them in their position by strips of adhesive plaster.
    If the wound be deep and extensive, the wound itself and the
    adjacent parts must be supported by proper bandages. The
    position of the patient should be such as will relax the skin
    and muscles of the wounded part. Rest, low and unstimulating
    diet, will complete the requirements necessary to a speedy
    recovery.</p>

    <p><b>How to Distinguish Death.</b>&mdash;As many instances
    occur of parties being buried alive, they being to all
    appearance dead, the great importance of knowing how to
    distinguish real from imaginary death need not be explained.
    The appearances which mostly accompany death, are an entire
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"
       id="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span> of breathing, of the heart's
       action; the eyelids are partly closed, the eyes glassy, and
       the pupils usually dilated; the jaws are clenched, the
       fingers partially contracted, and the lips and nostrils more
       or less covered with frothy mucus, with increasing pallor
       and coldness of surface, and the muscles soon become rigid
       and the limbs fixed in their position. But as these same
       conditions may also exist in certain other cases of
       suspended animation, great care should be observed, whenever
       there is the least doubt concerning it, to prevent the
       unnecessary crowding of the room in which the corpse is, or
       of parties crowding around the body; nor should the body be
       allowed to remain lying on the back without the tongue being
       so secured as to prevent the glottis or orifice of the
       windpipe being closed by it; nor should the face be closely
       covered; nor rough usage of any kind be allowed. In case
       there is great doubt, the body should not be allowed to be
       inclosed in the coffin, and under no circumstances should
       burial be allowed until there are unmistakable signs of
       decomposition.</p>

    <p>Of the numerous methods proposed as signs for real death, we
    select the following: 1. So long as breathing continues, the
    surface of a mirror held to the mouth and nostrils will become
    dimmed with moisture. 2. If a strong thread or small cord be
    tied tightly round the finger of a living person, the portion
    beyond the cord or thread will become red and swollen&mdash;if
    dead, no change is produced. 3. If the hand of a living person
    is held before a strong light a portion of the margin or edges
    of the fingers is translucent&mdash;if dead, every part of it
    is opaque. 4. A coal of fire, a piece of hot iron, or the flame
    of a candle, applied to the skin, if life remains, will
    blister&mdash;if dead it will merely sear. 5. A bright steel
    needle introduced and allowed to remain for half an hour in
    living flesh will be still bright&mdash;if dead, it will be
    tarnished by oxydation. 6. A few drops of a solution of atropia
    (two grains to one-half ounce of water) introduced into the
    eye, if the person is alive, will cause the pupils to
    dilate&mdash;if dead, no effect will be produced. 7. If the
    pupil is already dilated, and the person is alive, a few drops
    of tincture of the calabar bean will cause it to
    contract&mdash;if dead, no effect will be produced.</p>

    <p><b>Dislocations.</b>&mdash;These injuries can mostly be
    easily recognized; 1. By the deformity that the dislocation
    gives rise to by comparing the alteration in shape with the
    other side of the body. 2. Loss of some of the regular
    movements of the joints. 3. In case of dislocation, surgical
    aid should be procured at once. While waiting the arrival of a
    physician, the injured portion should be placed in the position
    most comfortable to the patient, and frequent cold bathing or
    cloths wrung out of cold water, applied to the parts affected,
    so as to relieve suffering and prevent inflammation.</p>

    <p><b>Foreign Bodies in Ears.</b>&mdash;Great care should be
    taken in removing foreign bodies from the ear, as serious
    injury may be inflicted. Most foreign bodies, especially those
    of small size, can be easily removed by the use of a syringe
    with warm water, and in most cases no other means should be
    used. Should the first efforts fail, repeat the operation. A
    syringe throwing a moderately small and continuous stream is
    the best adapted for the purpose, and the removal may generally
    be facilitated by inclining the ear downward while using the
    syringe. Severe inflammation may be excited, and serious injury
    done, by rash attempts to seize a foreign body in the ear, with
    a forceps or tweezers, or trying to pick it out with a pin or
    needle, or with an ear scoop. Should it be necessary from any
    cause to use instruments, great care should be observed, and
    but very little force exerted. It has lately been recommended,
    when foreign bodies cannot be removed by syringing the ear, to
    introduce a small brush or swab of frayed linen or muslin
    cloth, or a bit of sponge, moistened with a solution of glue,
    and keep it in contact with the foreign body until the glue
    adheres, when the body may be easily removed.</p>

    <p><b>Insects in the Ear.</b>&mdash;Insects in the ear may be
    easily killed by pouring oil in the ear, after which remove by
    syringing. (See foreign bodies in ear.)</p>

    <p><b>To Remove Hardened Ear Wax.</b>&mdash;Hardened car wax
    may be softened by dropping into the ear some oil or glycerine,
    and then syringing. (See foreign bodies in ear.)</p>

    <p><b>Foreign Bodies in Eye.</b>&mdash;To remove small
    particles from the eye, unless they have penetrated the globe,
    or become fixed in the conjunctiva, do as follows:</p>

    <p>Grasp the upper lid between the thumb and forefinger, lift
    it from the eyeball, and having drawn it down as far as
    possible outside the lower lid, let it slide slowly back to its
    place, resting upon the lower lid as it goes back; and then
    wipe the edges of the lids with a soft handkerchief to remove
    the foreign substance. This may be repeated a number of times,
    if necessary, without injury. Should this means fail, evert the
    lids and remove the foreign substance, by touching it lightly
    with the fold of a handkerchief, or with the point of a roll of
    paper made like a candle-lighter; or, if necessary, with a
    small pair of forceps. A drop of sweet oil instilled in the
    eye, while perfectly harmless, provokes a flow of tears that
    will frequently wash away any light substance.</p>

    <p>Bits of metal, sharp pieces of sand, etc. sometimes
    penetrate the globe of the eye, and, unless removed, may excite
    so much inflammation as to destroy the eye. They should he
    removed by a competent surgeon.</p>

    <p><b>Fainting.</b>&mdash;Lay the person who has fainted in a
    current of air, or in such a position that the air from an open
    window or door will have full play upon the face. Do not allow
    parties to crowd closely around, but give the sufferer plenty
    of room. Recovery will take place in a few minutes. The clothes
    also may be opened, and cold water sprinkled upon the face,
    hands and chest; and some pungent substance, as smelling salts,
    camphor, aromatic vinegar, etc., may be applied to the
    nostrils; and as soon as able to swallow, a little fresh water,
    or spirits and water, may be given. Persons who faint easily
    should avoid crowded rooms and places where the air is
    close.</p>

    <p><b>Fits.</b>&mdash;See Convulsions.</p>

    <p><b>Clothing on Fire.</b>&mdash;If a woman's clothes catch on
    fire, let her instantly roll herself over and over on the
    ground. In case any one be present, let them throw her down and
    do the like, and then wrap her up in a table-cloth, rug, coat,
    or the first woolen article that can be found.</p>

    <p><b>Fractures.</b>&mdash;As we can only give general rules
    for treating the various fractures, we would advise any one
    suffering from such to immediately apply to the nearest
    surgeon, and not rely upon an inexperienced party.</p>

    <p><b>Frost-Bite.</b>&mdash;Place the party suffering in a room
    without fire, and rub the frozen or frosted parts with snow, or
    pour ice-water over them until sensation begins to return. As
    soon as a stinging pain is felt, and a change of color appears,
    then cease the rubbing, and apply clothes wet with ice-water,
    and subsequently, if active inflammation follow and suppuration
    results, a solution of carbolic acid in water, one part to
    thirty, should be applied. If mortification set in, amputation
    is generally necessary. Where persons suffer from the
    constitutional effects of cold, hot stimulants should be given
    internally, and the body rubbed briskly with the hands and warm
    flannel.</p>

    <p><b>Poisons, Their Symptoms and Antidotes.</b>&mdash;When a
    person has taken poison, the first thing to do is to compel the
    patient to vomit, and for that purpose give any emetic that can
    be most readily and quickly obtained, and which is prompt and
    energetic, but safe in its
    action.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"
       id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span>

    <p>For this purpose there is, perhaps, nothing better than a
    large teaspoonful of ground mustard in a tumblerful of warm
    water, and it has the advantage of being almost always at hand.
    If the dry mustard is not to be had, use mixed mustard from the
    mustard pot. Its operation may generally be facilitated by the
    addition of a like quantity of common table salt. If the
    mustard is not at hand, give two or three teaspoonfuls of
    powdered alum in syrup or molasses, and give freely of warm
    water to drink; or give ten to twenty grains of sulphate of
    zinc (white vitriol), or twenty to thirty grains of ipecac,
    with one or two grains of tartar emetic, in a large cup of warm
    water, and repeat every ten minutes until three or four doses
    are given, unless free vomiting is sooner produced. After
    vomiting has taken place, large draughts of warm water should
    be given the patient, so that the vomiting will continue until
    the poisonous substances have been thoroughly evacuated, and
    then suitable antidotes should be given. If vomiting cannot be
    produced, the stomach-pump should be used. When it is known
    what particular kind of poison has been swallowed, then the
    proper antidote for that poison should be given, but when this
    cannot be ascertained, as is often the case, give freely of
    equal parts of calcined magnesia, pulverized charcoal, and
    sesquioxide of iron, in sufficient quantity of water. This is a
    very harmless mixture, and is likely to be of great benefit, as
    the ingredients, though very simple, are antidotes for the most
    common and active poisons. In case this mixture cannot be
    obtained, the stomach should be soothed and protected by the
    free administration of demulcent, mucilaginous or oleaginous
    drinks, such as the whites of eggs, milk, mucilage of gum
    arabic, or slippery elm bark, flaxseed tea, starch, wheat,
    flour, or arrow-root mixed in water, linseed or olive oil, or
    melted butter or lard. Subsequently the bowels should be moved
    by some gentle laxative, as a tablespoonful or two of castor
    oil, or a teaspoonful of calcined magnesia; and pain or other
    evidence of inflammation must be relieved by the administration
    of a few drops of laudanum, and the repeated application of hot
    poultices, fomentations and mustard plasters. The following are
    the names of the articles that may give rise to poisoning, most
    commonly used, and their antidote:</p>

    <p><b>Mineral Acids&mdash;Sulphuric Acid (Oil of Vitriol),
    Nitric Acid (Aqua Fortis), Muriatic Acid (Spirits of
    Salts).</b>&mdash;Symptoms: Acid, burning taste in the mouth,
    acute pain in the throat, stomach and bowels; frequent
    vomiting, generally bloody, mouth and lips excoriated,
    shriveled, white or yellow; hiccough, copious stools, more or
    less bloody, with great tenderness in the abdomen; difficult
    breathing, irregular pulse, excessive thirst, while drink
    increases the pain and rarely remains in the stomach; frequent
    but vain efforts to urinate; cold sweats, altered countenance;
    convulsions generally preceding death; nitric acid causes
    yellow stains; sulphuric acid, black ones. Treatment: Mix
    calcined magnesia in milk or water to the consistence of cream,
    and give freely to drink a glassful every couple of minutes, if
    it can be swallowed. Common soap (hard or soft), chalk,
    whiting, or even mortar from the wall mixed in water, may be
    given, until magnesia can be obtained. Promote vomiting by
    tickling the throat, if necessary, and when the poison is got
    rid of, flaxseed or elm tea, gruel, or other mild drinks. The
    inflammation which always follows wants good treatment to save
    the patient's life.</p>

    <p><b>Vegetable Acids&mdash;Acetic, Citric, Oxalic,
    Tartaric.</b>&mdash;Symptoms: Intense burning pain of mouth,
    throat and stomach; vomiting blood which is highly acid,
    violent purging, collapse, stupor, death.</p>

    <p><b>Oxalic Acid</b> is frequently taken in mistake for Epsom
    salts, to which in shops it often bears a strong resemblance.
    Treatment: Give chalk or magnesia in a large quantity of water,
    or large draughts of lime water. If these are not at hand,
    scrape the wall or ceiling, and give the scrapings, mixed with
    water.</p>

    <p><b>Prussic or Hydrocyanic Acid&mdash;Laurel Water, Cyanide
    of Potassium, Bitter Almond Oil, etc.</b>&mdash;Symptoms: In
    large doses almost invariably instantaneously fatal, when not
    immediately fatal, sudden loss of sense and control of the
    voluntary muscles; the odor of the poison generally susceptible
    on the breath. Treatment: Chlorine, in the form of chlorine
    water, in doses of from one to four fluid drachms, diluted.
    Weak solution of chloride lime of soda; water of ammonia
    (spirits of hartshorn) largely diluted may be given, and the
    vapor of it cautiously inhaled. Cold affusion, and chloroform
    in half to teaspoonful doses in glycerine or mucilage, repeated
    every few minutes, until the symptoms are ameliorated.
    Artificial respiration.</p>

    <p><b>Aconite&mdash;Monkshood, Wolfsbane.</b>&mdash;Symptoms:
    Numbness and tingling in the mouth and throat, and afterwards
    in other portions of the body, with sore throat, pain over the
    stomach, and vomiting; dimness of vision, dizziness, great
    prostration, loss of sensibility and delirium. Treatment: An
    emetic and then brandy in tablespoonful doses, in ice-water,
    every half hour; spirits of ammonia in half teaspoonful doses
    in like manner; the cold douche over the head and chest, warmth
    to the extremities, etc.</p>

    <p><b>Alkalies and their Salts&mdash;Concentrated Lye, Woodash
    Lye, Caustic Potash, Ammonia, Hartshorn.</b>&mdash;Symptoms:
    Caustic, acrid taste, excessive heat in the throat, stomach and
    <ins class="correction"
    title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'intenstines'.">
    intestines</ins>; vomiting of bloody matter, cold sweats, hiccough,
    purging of bloody stools.&mdash;Treatment: The common vegetable
    acids. Common vinegar being always at hand, is most frequently
    used. The fixed oils, as castor, flaxseed, almond and olive
    oils form soaps with the alkalies and thus also destroy their
    caustic effect. They should be given in large quantity.</p>

    <p><b>Alcohol, Brandy, and other Spirituous
    Liquors.</b>&mdash;Symptoms: Confusion of thought, inability to
    walk or stand, dizziness, stupor, highly flushed or pale face,
    noisy breathing.&mdash;Treatment: After emptying the stomach,
    pour cold water on the head and back of the neck, rub or slap
    the wrists and palms, and the ankles and soles of the feet, and
    give strong, hot coffee, or aromatic spirits of hartshorn, in
    teaspoonful doses in water. The warmth of the body must be
    sustained.</p>

    <p><b>Antimony, and its Preparations. Tartar Emetic, Antimonial
    Wine, Kerme's Mineral.</b>&mdash;Symptoms: Faintness and
    nausea, soon followed by painful and continued vomiting, severe
    diarrhoea, constriction and burning sensation in the throat,
    cramps, or spasmodic twitchings, with symptoms of nervous
    derangement, and great prostration of strength, often
    terminating in death.&mdash;Treatment: If vomiting has not been
    produced, it should be effected by tickling the fauces, and
    administering copious draughts of warm water. Astringment
    infusions, such as of gall, oak bark, Peruvian bark, act as
    antidotes, and should be given promptly. Powdered yellow bark
    may be used until the infusion is prepared, or very strong
    green tea should be given. To stop the vomiting, should it
    continue, blister over the stomach by applying a cloth wet with
    strong spirits of hartshorn, and then sprinkle on the
    one-eighth to one-fourth of a grain of morphia.</p>

    <p><b>Arsenic and its Preparations&mdash;Ratsbane, Fowler's
    Solution, etc.</b>&mdash;Symptoms: Generally within an hour
    pain and heat are felt in the stomach, soon followed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"
       id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span> vomiting, with a burning
       dryness of the throat and great thirst; the matters vomited
       are generally colored, either green yellow, or brownish, and
       sometimes bloody. Diarrhoea or dysentery ensues, while the
       pulse becomes small and rapid, yet irregular. Breathing much
       oppressed; difficulty in vomiting may occur, while cramps,
       convulsions, or even paralysis often precede death, which
       sometimes takes place within five or six hours after arsenic
       has been taken.&mdash;Treatment: Give a prompt emetic, and
       then hydrate of peroxide of iron (recently prepared) in
       tablespoonful doses every ten or fifteen minutes until the
       urgent symptoms are relieved. In the absence of this, or
       while it is being prepared, give large draughts of new milk
       and raw eggs, limewater and oil, melted butter, magnesia in
       a large quantity of water, or even if nothing else is at
       hand, flour and water, always, however, giving an emetic the
       first thing, or causing vomiting by tickling the throat with
       a feather, etc. The inflammation of the stomach which
       follows must be treated by blisters, hot fomentations,
       mucilaginous drinks, etc., etc.</p>

    <p><b>Belladonna or Deadly Night Shade.</b>&mdash;Symptoms:
    Dryness of the mouth and throat, great thirst, difficulty of
    swallowing, nausea, dimness, confusion or loss of vision, great
    enlargement of the pupils, dizziness, delirium and
    coma.&mdash;Treatment: There is no known antidote. Give a
    prompt emetic and then reliance must be placed on continual
    stimulation with brandy, whisky, etc., and to necessary
    artificial respiration. Opium and its preparations, as morphia,
    laudanum, etc., are thought by some to counteract the effect of
    belladonna, and may be given in small and repeated doses, as
    also strong black coffee and green tea.</p>

    <p><b>Blue Vitriol, or Blue Stone.</b>&mdash;See Copperas.</p>

    <p><b>Cantharides (Spanish or Blistering Fly) and Modern Potato
    Bug.</b>&mdash;Symptoms: Sickening odor of the breath, sour
    taste, with burning heat in the throat, stomach, and bowels;
    frequent vomiting, often bloody; copious bloody stools, great
    pain in the stomach, with burning sensation in the bladder and
    difficulty to urinate, followed with terrible convulsions,
    delirium and death.&mdash;Treatment excite vomiting by drinking
    plentifully of sweet oil or other wholesome oils, sugar and
    water, milk. or slippery elm tea; give injections of castor oil
    and starch, or warm milk. The inflammatory symptoms which
    generally follow must, be treated by a medical man. Camphorated
    oil or camphorated spirits should be rubbed over the bowels,
    stomach and thighs.</p>

    <p><b>Caustic Potash.</b>&mdash;See Alkalies.</p>

    <p><b>Cobalt, or Fly-Powder.</b>&mdash;Symptoms: Heat and pain
    in the. throat and stomach, violent retching and vomiting, cold
    and clammy skin, small and feeble pulse, hurried and difficult
    breathing, diarrhoea, etc.&mdash;Treatment: An emetic, followed
    by the free administration of milk, eggs, wheat flour and
    water, and mucilaginous drinks.</p>

    <p><b>Copper&mdash;Blue Vitriol, Verdigris or Pickles or Food
    Cooked in Soul Copper Vessels.</b>&mdash;Symptoms: General
    inflammation of the alimentary canal, suppression of urine;
    hiccough, a disagreeable metallic taste, vomiting, violent
    colic, excessive thirst, sense of tightness of the throat,
    anxiety; faintness, giddiness, and cramps and convulsions
    generally precede death.&mdash;Treatment: Large doses of simple
    syrup as warm as can be swallowed, until the stomach rejects
    the amount it contains. The whites of eggs and large quantities
    of milk. Hydrated peroxide of iron.</p>

    <p><b>Copperas.</b>&mdash;See Iron.</p>

    <p><b>Creosote.</b>&mdash;<b>Carbolic Acid.</b>&mdash;Symptoms:
    Burning pain. acrid, pungent taste, thirst, vomiting, purging,

    strength, feeble, fluttering pulse, faintness, nausea, and
    vomiting and stupor; cold perspiration, dilated pupils,
    sighing, irregular breathing, and sometimes
    convulsions.&mdash;Treatment: After vomiting, give brandy and
    ammonia in frequently repeated doses, apply warmth to the
    extremities, and if necessary resort to artificial
    respiration.</p>

    <p><b>Gases&mdash;Carbonic Acid, Chlorine, Cyanogen,
    Hydrosulphuric Acid, etc.</b>&mdash;Symptoms: Great drowsiness,
    difficult respiration, features swollen, face blue as in
    strangulation.&mdash;Treatment: Artificial respirations, cold
    douche, frictions with stimulating substances to the surface of
    the body. Inhalation of steam containing preparations of
    ammonia. Cupping from nape of neck. Internal use of
    chloroform.</p>

    convulsions.&mdash;Treatment: Excite speedy vomiting by large
    draughts of warm water, molasses and water, tickling the throat
    with the finger or a feather, and emetics; give oily and
    mucilaginous drinks, oily purgatives, and clysters, acids,
    strong coffee, camphor and opium.</p>

    <p><b>Hemlock (Conium).</b>&mdash;Symptoms: Dryness of the
    throat, tremors, dizziness, difficulty of swallowing,
    prostration and faintness, limbs powerless or paralyzed, pupils
    dilated, pulse rapid and feeble; insensibility and convulsions
    sometimes precede death.&mdash;Treatment: Empty the stomach and
    give brandy in tablespoonful doses, with half teaspoonful of
    spirits of Ammonia, frequently repeated, and if much pain and
    vomiting, give bromide of ammonium in five-grain doses every
    half hour. Artificial respiration may be required.</p>

    lacerating pain in the stomach, fruitless effort to vomit,
    excessive tenderness of the epigastrium. Treatment: Free
    emesis, prompt administration of starch, wheat flour, or
    arrowroot, beat up in water.</p>

    <p><b>Lead.&mdash;Acetate of Lead, Sugar of Lead, Dry White
    Lead, Red Lead, Litharge, or Pickles, Wine, or Vinegar,
    Sweetened by Lead.</b>&mdash;Symptoms: When taken in large
    doses, a sweet but astringent metallic taste exists, with
    constriction in the throat, pain in the region of the stomach,
    painful, obstinate, and frequently bloody vomitings, hiccough,
    convulsions or spasms, and death. When taken in small but
    long-continued doses, it produces colic, called painter's
    colic; great pain, obstinate constipation, and in extreme cases
    paralytic, symptoms, especially wrist-drop, with a blue line
    along the edge of the gums. Treatment: To counteract the
    poison, give alum in water, one and a half ounce to a quart;
    or, better still, Epsom salts or Glauber salts, an ounce of
    either in a quart of water; or dilute sulphuric acid, a
    teaspoonful in a quart of water. If a large quantity of sugar
    of lead has been recently taken, empty the stomach by an emetic
    of sulphate of zinc (one drachm in a quart of water), giving
    one-fourth <span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"
       id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span> to commence, and repeating
       smaller doses until free vomiting is produced; castor oil
       should be given to clear the bowels, and injections of oil
       and starch freely administered. If the body is cold, use the
       warm bath.</p>

    <p><b>Lunar Caustic.</b>&mdash;See Silver.</p>

    <p><b>Lobelia.</b>&mdash;Indian Poke.&mdash;Symptoms: Excessive
    vomiting and purging, pains in the bowels, contraction of the
    pupils, delirium, coma, and convulsions. Treatment: Mustard
    over the stomach, and brandy and ammonia.</p>

    <p><b>Mercury.&mdash;Corrosive Sublimate</b> (bug poisons
    frequently contain this poison), <b>Red Precipitate, Chinese or
    English Vermillion.</b>&mdash;Symptoms: Acrid, metallic taste
    in the mouth, immediate constriction and burning in the throat,
    with anxiety and tearing pains in both stomach and bowels,
    sickness, and vomiting of various colored fluids, and sometimes
    bloody and profuse diarrhoea, with difficulty and pain in
    urinating; pulse quick, small and hard; faint sensations, great
    debility, difficult breathing, cramps, cold sweats, syncope and
    convulsions. Treatment: If vomiting does not already exist,
    emetics must be given immediately&mdash;albumen of eggs in
    continuous large doses, and infusion of catechu afterwards,
    sweet milk, mixtures of flour and water in successive cupfuls,
    and to check excessive salivation put a half ounce of chlorate
    of potash in a tumbler of water, and use freely as a gargle,
    and swallow a tablespoonful every hour or two.</p>

    <p><b>Monkshood.</b>&mdash;See Arnica.</p>

    <p><b>Morphine.</b>&mdash;See Opium.</p>

    <p><b>Nitrate of Silver (Lunar Caustic.)</b>&mdash;Symptoms:
    Intense pain and vomiting and purging of blood; mucus and
    shreds of mucus membranes; and if these stand they become dark.
    Treatment: Give freely of a solution of common salt in water,
    which decomposes the poison, and afterwards flax-seed or elm
    bark tea, and after a while a dose of castor oil.</p>

    <p><b>Nux Vomica.</b>&mdash;See Strychnine.</p>

    <p><b>Opium and all its Preparations&mdash;Morphine, Laudanum,
    Paregoric, etc.</b>&mdash;Symptoms: Giddiness, drowsiness,
    increasing to stupor, and insensibility; pulse usually, at
    first, quirk and irregular, and breathing hurried, and
    afterwards pulse slow and feeble, and respiration slow and
    noisy; the pupils are contracted and the eyes and face
    congested, and later, as death approaches, the extremities
    become cold, the surface is covered with cold, clammy
    perspiration, and the sphincters relax. The effects of opium
    and its preparations, in poisonous doses, appear in from a half
    to two hours from its administration. Treatment: Empty the
    stomach immediately with an emetic or with the stomach pump.
    Then give very strong coffee without milk; put mustard plasters
    on the wrist and ankles; use the cold douche to the head and
    chest, and if the patient is cold and sinking give brandy, or
    whisky and ammonia. Belladonna is thought by many to counteract
    the poisonous effects of opium, and may be given in doses of
    half to a teaspoonful of the tincture, or two grains of the
    extract, every twenty minutes, until some effect is observed in
    causing the pupils to expand. Use warmth and friction, and if
    possible prevent sleep for some hours, for which purpose the
    patient should be walked about between two persons, and if
    necessary a bunch of switches may be freely used. Finally, as a
    last resort, use artificial respiration, and a persistance in
    it will sometimes be rewarded with success in apparently
    hopeless cases. Galvanism should also be tried.</p>

    <p><b>Oxalic Acid.</b>&mdash;See Acids.</p>

    <p><b>Phosphorus&mdash;Found in Lucifer Matches and some Rat
    Poisons.</b>&mdash;Symptoms: Symptoms of irritant poisoning;
    pain in the stomach and bowels; vomiting; diarrhoea; tenderness
    and tension of the abdomen. Treatment: An emetic is to be
    promptly given; copious draughts containing magnesia in
    suspension: mucilaginous drinks. General treatment for
    inflammatory symptoms.</p>

    <p><b>Poisonous Fish.</b>&mdash;Symptoms: In an hour or
    two&mdash;often in much shorter time&mdash;after the fish has
    been eaten, a weight at the stomach comes on, with slight
    vertigo and headache; sense of heat about the head and eyes;
    considerable thirst, and often an eruption of the skin.
    Treatment: After full vomiting, an active purgative should be
    given to remove any of the noxious matter from the intestines.
    Vinegar and water may be drunk after the above remedies have
    operated, and the body may be sponged with the same. Water made
    very sweet with sugar, with aromatic spirits of ammonia added,
    may be drunk freely as a corrective. A solution of cholorate of
    potash, or of alkali, the latter weak, may be given to obviate
    the effect of the poison. If spasms ensue after evacuation,
    laudanum in considerable doses it necessary. If inflammation
    should occur, combat in the usual way.</p>

    <p><b>Poisonous Mushrooms.</b>&mdash;- Symptoms: Nausea, heat
    and pains in the stomach and bowels; vomiting and purging,
    thirst, convulsions and faintings, pulse small and frequent,
    dilated pupil and stupor, cold sweats and death.</p>

    <p>Treatment: The stomach and bowels are to be cleared by an
    emetic of ground mustard or sulphate of zinc, followed by
    frequent doses of Glauber of Epsom salts, and large stimulating
    clysters. After the poison is evacuated, either may be given
    with small quantities of brandy and water. But if inflammatory
    symptoms manifest themselves, such stimuli should be avoided,
    and these symptoms appropriately treated.</p>

    <p><b>Potash.</b>&mdash;See Alkali.</p>

    <p><b>Prussic Acid, Hydrocyanic.</b>&mdash;See Acids.</p>

    <p><b>Poison Ivy.</b>&mdash;Symptoms. Contact with, and with
    many persons the near approach to the vine, gives rise to
    violent erysipelatous inflammation, especially of the face and
    hands, attended with itching, redness, burning and swelling,
    with watery blisters.</p>

    <p>Treatment: Give saline laxatives, and apply weak lead and
    laudanum, or limewater and sweet oil, or bathe the parts freely
    with spirits of nitre. Anointing with oil will prevent
    poisoning from it.</p>

    <p><b>Saltpetre, Nitrate of Potash.</b>&mdash;Symptoms. Only
    poisonous in large quantities, and then causes nausea, painful
    vomiting, purging, convulsions, faintness, feeble pulse, cold
    feet and hands, with tearing pains in stomach and bowels.</p>

    <p>Treatment: Treat just as is directed for arsenic, for there
    is no antidote known, and emptying the stomach and bowels with
    mild drinks must be relied on.</p>

    <p><b>Savine.</b>&mdash;Symptoms: Sharp pains in the bowels,
    hot skin, rapid pulse, violent vomiting and sometimes purging,
    with great prostration. Treatment: Mustard and hot fomentations
    over the stomach and bowels, and ice only allowed in the
    stomach until the inflammation ceases. If prostration comes on,
    food and stimulants must be given by injection.</p>

    <p><b>Stramonium, Thorn-apple or Jamestown
    Weed.</b>&mdash;Symptoms: Vertigo, headache, perversion of
    vision, slight delirium, sense of suffocation, disposition to
    sleep, bowels relaxed and all secretions augmented. Treatment:
    Same as Belladonna.</p>

    <p><b>Strychnine and Nux Vomica.</b>&mdash;Symptoms: Muscular
    twitching, constriction of the throat, difficult breathing and
    oppression of the chest; violent muscular spasms then occur,
    continuous in character like lock-jaw, with the body
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"
       id="page82"></a>[pg 82]</span> backwards, sometimes like a
       bow. Treatment: Give, if obtainable, one ounce or more of
       bone charcoal mixed with water, and follow with an active
       emetic; then give chloroform in teaspoonful doses, in flour
       and water or glycerine, every few minutes while the spasms
       last, and afterwards brandy and stimulants, and warmth of
       the extremities if necessary. Recoveries have followed the
       free and prompt administration of oils or melted butter or
       lard. In all cases empty the stomach if possible.</p>

    <p><b>Sulphate of Zinc, White Vitriol.</b>&mdash;See Zinc.</p>

    <p><b>Tin&mdash;Chloride of Tin, Solution of Tin (Used by
    Dyers), Oxide of Tin or Putty Powder.</b>&mdash;Symptoms:
    Vomiting, pains in the stomach, anxiety, restlessness, frequent
    pulse, delirium, etc. Treatment: Empty the stomach, and give
    whites of eggs in water, milk in large quantities, or flour
    beaten, up in water, with magnesia or chalk.</p>

    <p><b>Tartar Emetic.</b>&mdash;See Antimony.</p>

    <p><b>Tobacco.</b>&mdash;Symptoms: Vertigo, stupor, fainting,
    nausea, vomiting, sudden nervous debility, cold sweat, tremors,
    and at times fatal prostration. Treatment: After the stomach is
    empty apply mustard to the abdomen and to the extremities, and
    give strong coffee, with brandy and other stimulants, with
    warmth to the extremities.</p>

    <p><b>Zinc&mdash;Oxide of Zinc, Sulphate of Zinc, White
    Vitriol, Acetate of Zinc.</b>&mdash;Symptoms: Violent vomiting,
    astringent taste, burning pain in the stomach, pale
    countenance, cold extremities, dull eyes, fluttering pulse.
    Death seldom ensues, in consequence of the emetic effect.
    Treatment: The vomiting may be relieved by copious draughts of
    warm water. Carbonate of soda, administered in solution, will
    decompose the sulphate of zinc. Milk and albumen will also act
    as antidotes. General principles to be observed in the
    subsequent treatment.</p>

    <p><b>Woorara.</b>&mdash;Symptoms: When taken into the stomach
    it is inert; when absorbed through a wound it causes sudden
    stupor and insensibility, frothing at the mouth and speedy
    death. Treatment: Suck the wound immediately, or cut it out and
    tie a cord around the limb between the wound and the heart.
    Apply iodine, or iodide of potassium, and give it internally,
    and try artificial respiration.</p>

    <p><b>Scalds.</b>&mdash;See Burns and Scalds.</p>

    <p><b>Sprains.</b>&mdash;The portions most frequently
    implicated are the wrist and ankle; no matter which portion it
    may be, however, rest and quietness is a very important part of
    the treatment, and, when possible, in an elevated position. If
    the wrist is sprained it should be carried in a sling; if the
    ankle, it should be supported on a couch or stool. Cold lotions
    (see Bruises) should be freely applied, and irrigation by
    pouring water from a pitcher or tea-kettle resorted to several
    times a day to prevent inflammation. Later, frictions with
    opodeldoc, or with some stimulating liniment, and supporting
    the parts by pressure made with a flannel roller, or laced
    stocking when the ankle is involved, will be useful to restore
    tone; or strips of adhesive plaster properly applied will be
    useful for the same purpose. Recovery from severe sprains is
    always tedious. It is an old saying "that a bad sprain is worse
    than a broken bone."</p>

    <p><b>Stings of Bees and Wasps.</b>&mdash;See Bites and
    Stings.</p>

    <p><b>Suffocation from Noxious Gases, Foul Air, Fire Damp,
    Etc.</b>&mdash;Remove to fresh air and dash cold water over the
    head, neck and chest; carefully apply hartshorn, or smelling
    salts to the nostrils, and when the breathing is feeble or has
    ceased, resort immediately to artificial respiration (see
    Asphyxia and Drowning). Keep up the warmth of the body, and as
    soon as the patient can swallow give stimulants in small
    quantities.</p>

    <p><b>Sunstroke.</b>&mdash;This is caused by long exposure in
    great heat, especially when accompanied with great fatigue and
    exhaustion. Though generally happening from exposure to the
    sun's rays, yet precisely similar effects may be and are
    produced from any undue exposure to great and exhaustive heat,
    such as workmen are exposed to in foundries, gas factories,
    bakeries, and other similar employments. Its first symptom is
    pain in the head and dizziness, quickly followed by loss of
    consciousness, and resulting in complete prostration:
    sometimes, however, the attack is sudden, as in apoplexy. The
    head is generally burning hot, the face, dark and swollen, the
    breathing labored and snoring, and the feet and hands cold.
    Remove the patient at once to a cool and shady place, and lay
    him down with his head a little raised; apply ice or iced water
    to the head and face; loosen all cloths around the neck or
    waist; bathe the chest with cold water, apply mustard plasters,
    or cloths wetted with turpentine, to the calves and soles of
    the feet, and as soon as the patient can swallow, give weak
    brandy or whisky and water.</p>

    <h2>THE FAMILY PHYSICIAN</h2>

    <p>The following receipts written by DR. J. H. GUNN will be
    found of great value, especially in emergencies:</p>

    <p><b>Asthma.</b>&mdash;Take hyssop water and poppy water, of
    each ten ounces; oxymel of squills, six ounces; syrup of maiden
    hair, two ounces. Take one spoonful when you find any
    difficulty in breathing.</p>

    <p><b>Ague in the Breast.</b>&mdash;Take one part of gum
    camphor, two parts yellow bees-wax, three parts clean lard; let
    all melt slowly, in any vessel [earthen best], on stove. Use
    either cold or warm; spread very thinly on cotton or linen
    cloths, covering those with flannel. No matter if the breast is
    broken, it will cure if persevered in. Do not, no matter how
    painful, cease from drawing milk from the breast that is
    affected.</p>

    <p><b>Ague, Mixture.</b>&mdash;Mix twenty grains quinine with
    one pint diluted gin or port wine, and add ten grains
    subcarbonate of iron. Dose, a wine-glass each hour until the
    ague is broken, and then two or three times a day until the
    whole has been used.</p>

    <p>2. Take Peruvian bark, two ounces; wild cherry tree bark, 1
    ounce; cinnamon, one drachm; powdered capsicum, one
    teaspoonful; sulphur, one ounce; port wine, two quarts. Let it
    stand a day or two. Dose, a wine-glassful every two or three
    hours until the disease is broken, and then two or three times
    a day until all is taken.</p>

    <p><b>Sprained Ankle.</b>&mdash;Wash the ankle frequently with
    cold salt and water, which is far better than warm vinegar or
    decoctions of herbs. Keep your foot as cold as possible to
    prevent inflammation, and sit with it elevated on a cushion.
    Live on very low diet, and take every day some cooling
    medicine. By obeying these directions only, a sprained ankle
    has been cured in a few days.</p>

    <p><b>Apoplexy.</b>&mdash;Occurs only in the corpulent or
    obese, and the gross or high livers. To treat, raise the head
    to a nearly upright position; unloose all tight clothes,
    strings, etc., and apply cold water to the head and warm water
    and warm cloths to the feet. Have the apartment cool and well
    ventilated. Give nothing by the mouth until the breathing is
    relieved, and then only draughts of cold water.</p>

    <p><b>Preparation for the Cure of Baldness.</b>&mdash;Rum, one
    pint; alcohol, one ounce; distilled water, one ounce, tincture
    of cantharides, a half drachm; carbonate of potash, a half
    drachm; carbonate of ammonia, one drachm. Mix the liquids after
    having dissolved the salts, and filter. After the skin of the
    head has been wetted with this preparation for several minutes,
    it should be washed with water.</p>

    <p><b>Bilious Colic.</b>&mdash;Mix two tablespoonfuls of Indian
    meal in half a pint of cold water; drink it at two
    draughts.</p>

    <p><b>Bilious Complaints.</b>&mdash;Take the root and branch of
    dandelion, and steep it in soft water a sufficient length of
    time to extract all the essence; then strain the liquor and
    simmer until it becomes quite thick. Dose: From one to three
    glasses a day may be taken with good effect.</p>

    <p><b>Blackberry Cordial.</b>&mdash;To one quart blackberry
    juice add one pound white sugar, one tablespoonful each cloves,
    allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg. Boil together fifteen minutes,
    and add a wine-glass of whisky, brandy or rum. Bottle while
    hot, cork tight and seal. Used in diarrhea and dysentery. Dose,
    a wine-glassful for an adult, half that quantity for a child.
    It can be taken three or four times a day if the case is
    severe.</p>

    <p><b>Blisters.</b>&mdash;- On the feet, occasioned by walking,
    are cured by drawing a needleful of worsted thread through
    them; clip it off at both ends and leave it till the skin peals
    off.</p>

    <p><b>Raising Blood.</b>&mdash;Make a tea of white oak bark,
    and drink freely during the day; or take half a pound of yellow
    dock root, boil in new milk, say one quart: drink one gill
    three times a day, and take one pill of white pine pitch every
    day.</p>

    <p><b>How to Stop Blood.</b>&mdash;Take the fine dust of tea,
    or the scrapings of the inside of tanned leather. Bind it upon
    the wound closely, and blood will soon cease to flow.</p>

    <p><b>Boils.</b>&mdash;Make a poultice of ginger and flour, and
    lay it on the boil. This will soon draw it to a head.</p>

    <p><b>Swelled Bowels in Children.</b>&mdash;Bathe the stomach
    of the child with catnip steeped, mixed with fresh butter and
    sugar.</p>

    <p><b>Chilblains.</b>&mdash;Dr. Fergus recommends sulphurous
    acid in this affection. It should be applied with a camel's
    hair brush, or by means of a spray producer. One application of
    this effects a cure. The acid should be used pure. A good wash
    for hands or feet affected with chilblains is sulphurous acid,
    three parts; glycerine, one part, and water one part. The acid
    will be found particularly useful in the irritating, tormenting
    stage of chilblains.</p>

    <p><b>Chilblains and Chapped Hands.</b>&mdash;When chilblains
    manifest themselves, the best remedy not only for preventing
    their ulcerating, but overcoming the tingling, itching pain,
    and stimulating the circulation of the part to healthy action,
    is the liniment of belladona, two drachms; the liniment of
    aconite, one drachm; carbolic acid, ten drops; collodion
    flexile, one ounce; painted with a camel's hair pencil over
    their surface. When the chilblains vesicate, ulcerate or
    slough, it is better to omit the aconite and apply the other
    components of the liniment without it. The collodion
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"
       id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span> forms a coating or protecting
       film, which excludes the air, while the sedative liniments
       allay the irritation, generally of no trivial nature. For
       chapped hands we advise the free use of glycerine and good
       oil, in the proportion of two parts of the former to four of
       the latter; after this has been well rubbed into the hands
       and allowed to remain for a little time, and the hands
       subsequently washed with Castile soap and water, we
       recommend the belladonna and collodion flexile to be painted
       on, and the protective film allowed to remain permanently.
       These complaints not unfrequently invade persons of languid
       circulation and relaxed habit, who should be put on a
       generous regimen, and treated with ferruginous tonics.
       Obstinate, cases are occasionally met with which no local
       application will remedy, unless some disordered state of the
       system is removed, or the general condition of the patient's
       health improved. Chapped lips are also benefited by the
       stimulating form of application we advocate, but the aconite
       must not be allowed to get on the lips, or a disagreeable
       tingling results.</p>

    <p><b>Chilblain Balm.</b>&mdash;Boil together ten fluid ounces
    olive oil, two fluid ounces Venice turpentine, and one ounce
    yellow wax; strain, and while still warm add, constantly
    stirring, two and a half drachms balsam of Peru and ten grains
    camphor.</p>

    <p><b>Cure for Chilblain.</b>&mdash;Make a strong lye by
    boiling wood ashes in water. Put your feet in a small tub and
    cover them with the lye as hot as you can bear it. Gradually
    add more lye, hotter and hotter. Keep them in half an hour,
    bathing and rubbing them continually, and being very careful to
    keep the lye hot.</p>

    <p><b>Chilblain Lotion.</b>&mdash;Dissolve one ounce muriate of
    ammonia in one-half pint cider vinegar, and apply frequently.
    One-half pint of alcohol may be added to this lotion with good
    effects.</p>

    <p><b>Chilblain Ointment.</b>&mdash;Take mutton tallow and
    lard, of each three-fourths of a pound avoirdupois; melt, in an
    iron vessel, and add hydrated oxide of iron, two ounces,
    stirring continually with an iron spoon until the mass is of a
    uniform black color; when nearly cool add Venice turpentine,
    two ounces; Armenian bole, one ounce; oil of bergamot, one
    drachm; rub up the bole with a little olive oil before putting
    it in. Apply several times daily by putting it upon lint or
    linen. It heals the worst cases in a few days.</p>

    <p><b>Russian Remedy for Chilblains.</b>&mdash;Slices of the
    rind of fully ripe cucumbers, dried with the soft parts
    attached. Previous to use they are softened by soaking them in
    warm water, and are then bound on the sore parts with the inner
    side next them, and left on all night. This treatment is said
    to be adopted for both broken and unbroken chilblains.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Itching Chilblains.</b>&mdash;Take
    hydrochloric acid, one part, and water, eight parts; mix. Apply
    on going to bed. This must not be used if the skin is broken.
    Sal ammoniac, two ounces; rum, one pint; camphor, two drachms.
    The affected part is wetted night and morning, and when dry is
    touched with a little simple ointment of any kind&mdash;cold
    cream or pomatum.</p>

    <p>Oil of turpentine, four ounces; camphor, six drachms; oil of
    cajeput, two drachms. Apply with friction.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Broken Chilblains.</b>&mdash;Mix together
    four fluid ounces collodion, one and a half fluid ounces Venice
    turpentine, and one fluid ounce castor oil.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Corns.</b>&mdash;Take equal parts of
    mercurial and galbanum ointments; mix them well together,
    spread on a piece of soft leather, and apply it to the corns
    morning and evening. In a few days benefit will be derived.
    Take two ounces of gum ammoniac, two ounces of yellow wax, and
    six ounces of verdigris; melt them together, and spread the
    composition on soft leather; cut away as much of the corn as
    you can, then apply the plaster, and renew it every fortnight
    till the corn is away. Get four ounces of white diachylon
    plaster, four ounces of shoemaker's wax, and sixty drops of
    muriatic acid or spirits of salt. Boil them for a few minutes
    in an earthen pipkin, and when cold roll the mass between the
    hands, and apply it on a piece of white leather. Soak the feet
    well in warm water, then with a sharp instrument pare off as
    much of the corn as can be done without pain, and bind up the
    part with a piece of linen or muslin thoroughly saturated with
    sperm oil, or, which is better, the oil which floats upon the
    surface of the herring or mackerel. After three or four days
    the dressing may be removed by scraping, when the new skin will
    be found of a soft and healthy texture, and less liable to the
    formation of a new corn than before. Corns may be prevented by
    wearing easy shoes. Bathe the feet frequently in lukewarm
    water, with a little salt or potashes dissolved in it. The corn
    itself will be completely destroyed by rubbing it often with a
    little caustic solution of potash till the soft skin is formed.
    Scrape to a pulp sufficient Spanish garlic, and bind on the
    corn over night, after first soaking it well in warm water, and
    scrape off as much as possible of the hardened portion in the
    morning. Repeat the application as required.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Soft Corns.</b>&mdash;Scrape a piece of
    common chalk, and put a pinch to the soft corn, and bind a
    piece of linen rag upon it.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Tender Corns.</b>&mdash;A strong solution of
    tannic acid is said to be an excellent application to tender
    feet as well as a preventive of the offensive odor attendant
    upon their profuse perspiration. To those of our readers who
    live far away in the country, we would suggest a strong
    decoction of oak bark as a substitute.</p>

    <p><b>Caustic for Corns.</b>&mdash;Tincture of iodine, four
    drachms: iodide of iron, twelve grains; chloride of antimony,
    four drachms; mix, and apply with a camel's hair brush, after
    paring the corn. It is said to cure in three times.</p>

    <p><b>How to Relieve Corns.</b>&mdash;Bind them up at night
    with a cloth wet with tincture of arnica, to relieve the pain,
    and during the day occasionally moisten the stocking over the
    corn with arnica if the shoe is not large enough to allow the
    corn being bound up with a piece of linen rag.</p>

    <p><b>Remedy for Corns.</b>&mdash;1. The pain occasioned by
    corns may be greatly alleviated by the following preparation:
    Into a one-ounce vial put two drachms of muriatic acid and six
    drachms of rose-water. With this mixture wet the corns night
    and morning for three days. Soak the feet every evening in warm
    water without soap. Put one-third of the acid into the water,
    and with a little picking the corn will be dissolved. 2. Take a
    lemon, cut off a small piece, then nick it so as to let in the
    toe with the corn, tie this on at night so that it cannot move,
    and in the morning you will find that, with a blunt knife, you
    may remove a considerable portion of the corn. Make two or
    three applications, and great relief will be the result.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Solvent Corns.</b>&mdash;Expose salt of
    tartar (pearlash) in a wide-mouth vial in a damp place until it
    forms an oil-like liquid, and apply to the corn.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Cholera.</b>&mdash;Take laudanum, tincture
    cayenne, compound tincture rhubarb, peppermint, and camphor, of
    each equal parts. Dose, ten to thirty drops. In plain terms,
    take equal parts tincture of opium, red pepper, rhubarb,
    peppermint and camphor, and mix them for use. In case of
    diarroea, take a dose of ten to twenty drops in three or four
    teaspoonfuls of water. No one who has this by him, and takes it
    in time, will ever have the cholera.</p>

    <p><b>Signs of Disease in Children.</b>&mdash;In the case of a
    baby not yet able to talk, it must cry when it is ill. The
    colic <span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"
       id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span> baby cry loud, long, and
       passionately, and shed tears&mdash;stopping for a moment and
       beginning again.</p>

    <p>If the chest is affected, it gives one sharp cry, breaking
    off immediately, as if crying hurt it.</p>

    <p>If the head is affected, it cries in sharp, piercing
    shrieks, with low moans and wails between. Or there may be
    quiet dozing, and startings between.</p>

    <p>It is easy enough to perceive, where a child is attacked by
    disease, that there has some change taken place; for either its
    skin will be dry and hot, its appetite gone; it is stupidly
    sleepy, or fretful or crying; it is thirsty, or pale and
    languid, or in some way betrays that something is wrong. When a
    child vomits, or has a diarrhoea, or is costive and feverish,
    it is owing to some derangement, and needs attention. But these
    various symptoms may continue for a day or two before the
    nature of the disease can be determined. A warm bath, warm
    drinks, etc., can do no harm, and may help to determine the
    case. On coming out of the bath, and being well rubbed with the
    hand, the skin will show symptoms of rash, if it is a skin
    disease which has commenced. By the appearance of the rash, the
    nature of the disease can be learned. Measles are in patches,
    dark red, and come out first about the face. If scarlet fever
    is impending, the skin will look a deep pink all over the body,
    though most so about the neck and face. Chicken-pox shows
    fever, but not so much running at the nose, and appearances of
    cold, as in measles, nor is there as much of a cough. Besides,
    the spots are smaller, and do not run much together, and are
    more diffused over the whole surface of the skin; and enlarge
    into blisters in a day or two.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Consumption.</b>&mdash;Take one tablespoonful
    of tar, and the yolks of three hen's eggs, beat them well
    together. Dose, one tablespoonful morning, noon and night.</p>

    <p><b>Croup, Remedy for in One Minute.</b>&mdash;This remedy is
    simply alum. Take a knife or grater, and shave or grate off in
    small particles about a teaspoonful of alum; mix it with about
    twice its quantity of sugar, to make it palatable, and
    administer as quickly as possible. Its effects will be truly
    magical, as almost instantaneous relief will be afforded.</p>

    <p><b>Cholera Remedy, Hartshorne's.</b>&mdash;Take of
    chloroform, tincture of opium, spirits of camphor, and spirits
    of aromatic ammonia, each one and one-half fluid drachms;
    creosote, three drops; oil of cinnamon, eight drops; brandy,
    two fluid drachms. Dilute a teaspoonful with a wine-glass of
    water, and give two teaspoonfuls every five minutes, followed
    by a lump of ice.</p>

    <p><b>Cure for Dandruff.</b>&mdash;Good mild soap is one of the
    safest remedies, and is sufficient in ordinary cases; carbonate
    of potash or soda is too alkaline for the skin. Every
    application removes a portion of the cuticle, as you may
    observe by the smoothness of the skin of your hands after
    washing them with it. Borax is recommended; but this is also
    soda combined with a weak acid, boracic acid, and may by
    protracted use also injuriously act on the scalp. Soap is also
    soda or potash combined with the weak, fatty acids; and when
    the soap contains an excess of the alkalies or is sharp, it is
    as injurious as the carbonate of potash. All that injures the
    scalp injures the growth of the hair. One of the best
    applications from the vegetable kingdom is the mucilaginous
    decoction of the root of the burdock, called bardane in French
    (botanical name, <i>Lappa Minor</i>). In the mineral kingdom
    the best remedy is a solution of flowers of sulphur in water,
    which may be made by the addition of a very small portion of
    sulphide of potassium, say ten or twenty grains to the pint.
    This solution is shaken up with the sulphur, and the clear
    liquid remaining on the top is used. This recipe is founded on
    the fact that sulphur is a poison for inferior vegetable or
    animal growth, like dandruff, itch, etc., and is not at all a
    poison for the superior animal like man.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Diphtheria.</b>&mdash;A French physician
    expresses his preference for lemon juice, as a local
    application in diphtheria, to chlorate of potash, nitrate of
    silver, perchloride of lime water. He uses it by dipping a
    little plug of cottonwood, twisted around a wire, in the juice,
    and pressing it against the diseased surface four or five times
    daily.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Bad Breath.</b>&mdash;Bad or foul breath will
    be removed by taking a teaspoonful of the following mixture
    after each meal: One ounce liquor of potassa, one ounce
    chloride of soda, one and one-half ounces phosphate of soda,
    and three ounces of water.</p>

    <p>2. Chlorate of potash, three drachms; rose-water, four
    ounces. Dose, a tablespoonful four or five times daily.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Bunions.</b>&mdash;A bunion is a swelling on
    the ball of the great toe, and is the result of pressure and
    irritation by friction. The treatment for corns applies also to
    bunions; but in consequence of the greater extension of the
    disease, the cure is more tedious. When a bunion is forming it
    may be stopped by poulticing and carefully opening it with a
    lancet.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Burns and Scalds.</b>&mdash;Take half a pound
    of powdered alum, dissolve it in a quart of water; bathe the
    burn or scald with a linen rag, wetted with this mixture, then
    bind the wet rag on it with a strip of linen, and moisten the
    bandage with the alum water frequently, without removing it
    during two or three days.</p>

    <p><b>Tea Leaves for Burns.</b>&mdash;Dr. Searles, of Warsaw,
    Wis., reports the immediate relief from pain in severe burns
    and scalds by the application of a poultice of tea leaves.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Cancer.</b>&mdash;Boil down the inner bark of
    red and white oak to the consistency of molasses; apply as a
    plaster, shifting it once a week; or, burn red-oak bark to
    ashes; sprinkle it on the sore till it is eaten out; then apply
    a plaster of tar; or, take garget berries and leaves of
    stramonium; simmer them together in equal parts of neatsfoot
    oil and the tops of hemlock; mix well together, and apply it to
    the parts affected; at the same time make a tea of winter-green
    (root and branch); put a handful into two quarts of water; add
    two ounces of sulphur and drink of this tea freely during the
    day.</p>

    <p><b>Castor Oil Mixture.</b>&mdash;Castor oil, one dessert
    spoonful; magnesia, one dessert spoonful. Rub together into a
    paste. By this combination, the taste of the oil is almost
    entirely concealed, and children take it without
    opposition.</p>

    <p><b>How to Disguise Castor Oil.</b>&mdash;Rub up two drops
    oil of cinnamon with an ounce of glycerine and add an ounce of
    castor oil. Children will take it as a luxury and ask for
    more.</p>

    <p><b>Castor Oil Emulsions.</b>&mdash;Take castor oil and
    syrup, each one ounce; the yolk of an egg, and orange flower
    water, one-half ounce. Mix. This makes a very pleasant
    emulsion, which is readily taken by adults as well as
    children.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Catarrh.</b>&mdash;Take the bark of sassafras
    root, dry and pound it, use it as a snuff, taking two or three
    pinches a day.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Chilblains.</b>&mdash;Wash the parts in
    strong alum water, apply as hot as can be borne.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Cold.</b>&mdash;Take three cents' worth of
    liquorice, three of rock candy, three of gum arabic, and put
    them into a quart of water; simmer them till thoroughly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"
       id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span> then add three cents' worth
       paregoric, and a like quantity of antimonial wine.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Corns.</b>&mdash;Boil tobacco down to an
    extract, then mix with it a quantity of white pine pitch, and
    apply it to the corn; renew it once a week until the corn
    disappears.</p>

    <p><b>Good Cough Mixture.</b>&mdash;Two ounces ammonia mixture;
    five ounces camphor mixture; one drachm tincture of digitalis
    (foxglove); one-half ounce each of sweet spirits of nitre and
    syrup of poppies; two drachms solution of sulphate of morphia.
    A tablespoonful of this mixture is to be taken four times a
    day.</p>

    <p>2. Tincture of blood-root, one ounce; sulphate of morphia,
    one and a half grains; tincture of digitalis, one-half ounce;
    wine of antimony, one-half ounce; oil of wintergreen, ten
    drops. Mix. Dose from twenty to forty drops twice or three
    times a day. Excellent for a hard, dry cough.</p>

    <p>3. Common sweet cider, boiled down to one-half, makes a
    most, excellent syrup for colds or coughs for children, is
    pleasant to the taste, and will keep for a year in a cool
    cellar. In recovering from an illness, the system has a craving
    for some pleasant drink. This is found in cider which is placed
    on the fire as soon as made, and allowed to come to a boil,
    then cooled, put in casks, and kept in a cool cellar.</p>

    <p>4. Roast a large lemon very carefully without burning; when
    it is thoroughly hot, cut and squeeze into a cup upon three
    ounces of sugar candy. finely powdered: take a spoonful
    whenever your cough troubles you. It is as good as it is
    pleasant.</p>

    <p><b>Cure for Deafness.</b>&mdash;Take ant's eggs and union
    juice. Mix and drop them into the ear. Drop into the ear, at
    night, six or eight drops of hot sweet oil.</p>

    <p><b>Remedies for Diarrhoea.</b>&mdash;1. Take one teaspoonful
    of salt, the same of good vinegar, and a tablespoonful of
    water; mix and drink. It acts like a charm on the system, and
    even one dose will generally cure obstinate cases of diarrhoea,
    or the first stages of cholera. If the first does not bring
    complete relief, repeat the dose, as it is quite harmless. 2.
    The best rhubarb root, pulverized, 1 ounce; peppermint leaf, 1
    ounce, capsicum, 1/8 ounce; cover with boiling water and steep
    thoroughly, strain, and add bicarbonate of potash and essence
    of cinnamon, of each 1/2 ounce; with brandy (or good whisky);
    equal in amount to the whole, and loaf sugar, four ounces.
    Dose&mdash;for an adult, 1 or 2 tablespoons; for a child, 1 to
    2 teaspoons, from 3 to 6 times per day, until relief is
    obtained. 3. To half a bushel of blackberries; well mashed, add
    a quarter of a pound of allspice, 2 ounces of cinnamon, 2
    ounces of cloves; pulverize well, mix and boil slowly until
    properly done; then strain or squeeze the juice through
    home-spun or flannel, and add to each pint of the juice 1 pound
    of loaf sugar, boil again for some time, take it off, and while
    cooling, add half a gallon of the best Cognac brandy.</p>

    <p><b>Cure for Chronic Diarroea.</b>&mdash;Rayer recommends the
    association of cinchona, charcoal and bismuth in the treatment
    of chronic diarrh a, in the following proportions: Subnitrate
    of bismuth, one drachm; cinchona, yellow, powdered, one-half
    drachm; charcoal, vegetable, one drachm. Make twenty powders
    and take two or three a day during the intervals between
    meals.</p>

    <p><b>Cures for Dysentery.</b>&mdash;Tincture rhubarb, tincture
    of capsicum, tincture of camphor, essence of ginger and
    laudanum, equal parts. Mix; shake well and take from ten to
    twenty drops every thirty minutes, until relief is obtained.
    This is a dose for an adult. Half the amount for a child under
    twelve years of age. 2. Take some butter off the churn,
    immediately after being churned, just as it is, without being
    salted or washed: clarify it over the fire like honey. Skim off
    all the milky particles when melted over a clear fire. Let the
    patient (if an adult) take two tablespoonfuls of the clarified
    remainder, twice or thrice within the day. This has never
    failed to effect a cure, and in many cases it has been almost
    instantaneous. 3. In diseases of this kind the Indians use the
    roots and leaves of the blackberry bush&mdash;- a decoction of
    which, in hot water, well boiled down, is taken in doses of a
    gill before each meal, and before retiring to bed. It is an
    almost infallible cure. 4. Beat one egg in a teacup; add one
    tablespoonful of loaf sugar and half a teaspoonful of ground
    spice; fill the cup with sweet milk. Give the patient one
    tablespoonful once in ten minutes until relieved. 5. Take one
    tablespoonful of common salt, and mix it, with two
    tablespoonfuls of vinegar and pour upon it a half pint of
    water, either hot or cold (only let it be taken cool.) A wine
    glass full of this mixture in the above proportions, taken
    every half hour, will he found quite efficacious in curing
    dysentery. If the stomach be nauseated, a wine-glass full taken
    every hour will suffice. For a child, the quantity should be a
    teaspoonful of salt and one of vinegar in a teacupful of
    water.</p>

    <p><b>Dropsy.</b>&mdash;Take the leaves of a currant bush and
    make into tea, drink it.</p>

    <p><b>Cure for Drunkenness.</b>&mdash;- The following singular
    means of curing habitual drunkenness is employed by a Russian
    physician. Dr. Schreiber, of Brzese Litewski: It consists in
    confining the drunkard in a room, and in furnishing him at
    discretion with his favorite spirit diluted with two-thirds of
    water; as much wine, beer and coffee as he desires, but
    containing one-third of spirit: all the food&mdash;the bread,
    meat, and the legumes are steeped in spirit and water. The poor
    devil is continually drunk and dort. On the fifth day of this
    regime he has an extreme disgust for spirit; he earnestly
    requests other diet: but his desire must not be yielded to
    until the poor wretch no longer desires to eat or drink: he is
    then certainly cured of his penchant for drunkenness. He
    acquires such a disgust for brandy or other spirits that he is
    ready to vomit at the very sight of it.</p>

    <p><b>Cure for Dyspepsia.</b>&mdash;1. Take bark of white
    poplar root, boil it thick, and add a little spirit, and then
    lay it on the stomach.</p>

    <p>2. Take wintergreen and black cherry-tree bark and yellow
    dock: put into two quarts of water; boil down to three pints;
    take two or three glasses a day.</p>

    <p>Here are two remedies for dyspepsia, said by those who "have
    tried them" to be infallible. 1. Eat onions. 2. Take two parts
    of well-dried and pounded pods of red pepper, mixed with one
    part of ground mustard, and sift it over everything you eat or
    drink.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Earache.</b>&mdash;Take a small piece of
    cotton batting or cotton wool, make a depression in the center
    with the finger, and then fill it up with as much ground pepper
    as will rest on a five-cent piece; gather it into a ball and
    tie it up; dip the ball into sweet oil and insert it in the
    ear, covering the latter with cotton wool, and use a bandage or
    cap to retain it in its place. Almost instant relief will be
    experienced; and the application is so gentle that an infant,
    will not get injured by it, but experience relief as well as
    adults. Roast a piece of lean mutton, squeeze out the juice and
    drop it info the ear as hot as it can be borne. Roast an onion
    and put into the ear as hot as it can be borne.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Erysipelas.</b>&mdash;Dissolve five ounces of

    <p><b>Cure for Inflamed Eyes.</b>&mdash;Pour boiling water on
    alder flowers, and steep them like tea; when cold, put three or
    four drops of laudanum into a small glass of the alder-tea, and
    let the mixture run into the eyes two or three times a day, and
    the eyes will become perfectly strong in the course of a
    week.</p>

    <p><b>Cure for Weeping Eyes.</b>&mdash;Wash the eyes in
    chamomile tea night and morning.</p>

    <p><b>Eyes, Granular Inflammation.</b>&mdash;A prominent
    oculist says that the contagious Egyptian or granular
    inflammation of the eyes is spreading throughout the country,
    and that he has been able in many, and indeed in a majority of
    cases, to trace the disease to what are commonly called rolling
    towels. Towels of this kind are generally found in country
    hotels and the dwellings of the working classes, and, being
    thus used by nearly every one, are made the carriers of one of
    the most troublesome diseases of the eye. This being the case,
    it is urgently recommended that the use of these rolling towels
    be discarded, and thus one of the special vehicles for the
    spread of a most dangerous disorder of the eyes&mdash;one by
    which thousands of workingmen are annually deprived of their
    means of support&mdash;will no longer exist.</p>

    <p><b>Cure for Sty in Eye.</b>&mdash;Bathe frequently with warm
    water. When the sty bursts, use an ointment composed of one
    part of citron ointment and four of spermaceti, well rubbed
    together, and smear along the edge of the eye-lid.</p>

    <p><b>Cure for Felons.</b>&mdash;1. Stir one-half teaspoonful
    of water into an ounce of Venice turpentine until the mixture
    appears like granulated honey. Wrap a good coating of it around
    the finger with a cloth. If the felon is only recent, the pain
    will be removed in six hours.</p>

    <p>2. As soon as the part begins to swell, wrap it with a cloth
    saturated thoroughly with the tincture of lobelia. An old
    physician says, that he has known this to cure scores of cases,
    and that it never fails if applied in season.</p>

    <p><b>Cure for Fever and Ague.</b>&mdash;Take of cloves and
    cream of tartar each one-half ounce, and one ounce of Peruvian
    bark. Mix in a small quantity of tea, and take it on well days,
    in such quantities as the stomach will bear.</p>

    <p><b>Cure for Fever Sores.</b>&mdash;Take of hoarhound, balm,
    sarsaparilla, loaf sugar, aloes, gum camphor, honey, spikenard,
    spirits of turpentine, each two ounces. Dose, one
    tablespoonful, three mornings, missing three; and for a wash,
    make a strong tea of sumach, washing the affected parts
    frequently, and keeping the bandage well wet.</p>

    <p><b>Cure for Fits.</b>&mdash;Take of tincture of fox-glove,
    ten drops at each time twice a day, and increase one drop at
    each time as long as the stomach will bear it, or it causes a
    nauseous feeling.</p>

    <p><b>Glycerine Cream.</b>&mdash;Receipt for chapped lips: Take
    of spermaceti, four drachms; white wax, one drachm; oil of
    almonds, two troy ounces; glycerine, one troy ounce. Melt the
    spermaceti, wax and oil together, and when cooling stir in
    glycerine and perfume.</p>

    <p><b>Glycerine Lotion.</b>&mdash;For softening the skin of the
    face and hands, especially during the commencement of cold
    weather, and also for allaying the irritation caused by the
    razor: Triturate, four and a half grains of cochineal with one
    and a half fluid ounces of boiling water, adding gradually;
    then add two and a half fluid ounces of alcohol. Also make an
    emulsion of eight drops of ottar of roses with thirty grains of
    gum arabic and eight fluid ounces of water; then add three
    fluid ounces of glycerine, and ten fluid drachms of quince
    mucilage. Mix the two liquids.</p>

    <p><b>Fleshworms.</b>&mdash;These specks, when they exist in
    any number, are a cause of much unsightliness. They are minute
    corks, if we may use the term, of coagulated lymp, which close
    the orifices of some of the pores or exhalent vessels of the
    skin. On the skin immediately adjacent to them being pressed
    with the finger nails, these bits of coagulated lymph will come
    from it in a vermicular form. They are vulgarly called "flesh
    worms," many persons fancying them to be living creatures.
    These may be got rid of and prevented from returning, by
    washing with tepid water, by proper friction with a towel, and
    by the application of a little cold cream. The longer these
    little piles are permitted to remain in the skin the more
    firmly they become fixed; and after a time, when they lose
    their moisture they are converted into long bony spines as
    dense as bristles, and having much of that character. They are
    known by the name of spotted achne. With regard to local
    treatment, the following lotions are calculated to be
    serviceable: 1. Distilled rose water, 1 pint; sulphate of zinc,
    20 to 60 grains. Mix. 2. Sulphate of copper, 20 grains;
    rosewater, 4 ounces; water, 12 ounces. Mix. 3. Oil of sweet
    almonds, 1 ounce; fluid potash, 1 drachm. Shake well together
    and then add rose-water, 1 ounce; pure water, 6 ounces. Mix.
    The mode of using these remedies is to rub the pimples for some
    minutes with a rough towel, and then dab them with the lotion.
    4. Wash the face twice a day with warm water, and rub dry with
    a coarse towel. Then with a soft towel rub in a lotion made of
    two ounces of white brandy, one ounce of cologne, and one-half
    ounce of liquor potassa.</p>

    <p><b>How to Remove Freckles.</b>&mdash;Freckles; so
    persistently regular in their annual return, have annoyed the
    fair sex from time immemorial, and various means have been
    devised to eradicate them, although thus far with no decidedly
    satisfactory results. The innumerable remedies in use for the
    removal of these vexatious intruders, are either simple and
    harmless washes, such as parsley or horseradish water,
    solutions of borax, etc., or injurious nostrums, consisting
    principally of lead and mercury salts.</p>

    <p>If the exact cause of freckles were known, a remedy for them
    might be found. A chemist in Moravia, observing the bleaching
    effect of mercurial preparations, inferred that the growth of a
    local parasitical fungus was the cause of the discoloration of
    the skin, which extended and ripened its spores in the warmer
    season. Knowing that sulpho-carbolate of zinc is a deadly enemy
    to all parasitic vegetation (itself not being otherwise
    injurious), he applied this salt for the purpose of removing
    the freckles. The compound consists of two parts of
    sulpho-carbolate of zinc, twenty-five parts of distilled
    glycerine, twenty-five parts of rose-water, and five parts of
    scented alcohol, and is to be applied twice daily for from half
    an hour to an hour, then washed off with cold water. Protection
    against the sun by veiling and other means is recommended, and
    in addition, for persons of pale complexion, some mild
    preparation of iron.</p>

    <p><b>Gravel.</b>&mdash;1. Make a strong tea of the low herb
    called heart's ease, and drink freely. 2. Make of Jacob's
    ladder a strong tea, and drink freely. 3. Make of bean leaves a
    strong tea, and drink freely.</p>

    <p><b>Wash for the Hair.</b>&mdash;Castile soap, finely shaved,
    one teaspoonful; spirits of hartshorn, one drachm; alcohol,
    five ounces; cologne water and bay rum, in equal quantities
    enough to make eight ounces. This should be poured on the head,
    followed by warm water (soft water); the result will be, on
    washing, a copious lather and a smarting sensation to the
    person operated on. Rub this well into the hair. Finally, rinse
    with warm water, and afterwards with cold water. If the head is
    very much clogged with dirt, the hair will come out
    plentifully, but the scalp will become white and perfectly
    clean.</p>

    <p><b>Hair Restorative.</b>&mdash;Take of castor oil, six fluid
    ounces; alcohol, twenty-six fluid ounces. Dissolve. Then add
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"
       id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span> of cantharides (made with
       strong alcohol), one fluid ounce; essence of jessamine (or
       other perfume), one and a half fluid ounces.</p>

    <p><b>Cure for Heartburn.</b>&mdash;Sal volatile combined with
    camphor is a splendid remedy.</p>

    <p><b>Sick Headache.</b>&mdash;Take a teaspoonful of powdered
    charcoal in molasses every morning, and wash it down with a
    little tea, or drink half a glass of raw rum or gin, and drink
    freely of mayweed tea.</p>

    <p><b>Headache.</b>&mdash;Dr. Silvers, of Ohio, in the
    Philadelphia <i>Medical and Surgical Reporter</i>, recommends
    ergot in headache, especially the nervous or sick headache. He
    says it will cure a larger proportion of cases than any other
    remedy. His theory of its action is that it lessens the
    quantity of blood in the brain by contracting the muscular
    fibres of the arterial walls. He gives ten to twenty drops of
    the fluid extract, repeated every half hour till relief is
    obtained, or four or five doses used. In other forms of
    disease, where opium alone is contra-indicated, its bad effects
    are moderated, he says, by combining it with ergot.</p>

    <p><b>Headache Drops.</b>&mdash;For the cure of nervous, sun,
    and sick headache, take two quarts of alcohol, three ounces of
    Castile soap, one ounce camphor, and two ounces ammonia. Bathe
    forehead and temples.</p>

    <p><b>Hive Syrup.</b>&mdash;Put one ounce each of squills and
    seneca snake-root into one pint of water; boil down to one-half
    and strain. Then add one-half pound of clarified honey
    containing twelve grains tartrate of antimony. Dose for a
    child, ten drops to one teaspoonful, according to age. An
    excellent remedy for croup.</p>

    <p><b>How to Clean the Hair.</b>&mdash;From the too frequent
    use of oils in the hair, many ladies destroy the tone and color
    of their tresses. The Hindoos have a way of remedying this.
    They take a hand basin filled with cold water, and have ready a
    small quantity of pea flour. The hair is in the first place
    submitted to the operation of being washed in cold water, a
    handful of the pea flour is then applied to the head and rubbed
    into the hair for ten minutes at least, the servant adding
    fresh water at short intervals, until it becomes a perfect
    lather. The whole head is then washed quite clean with copious
    supplies of the aqueous fluid, combed, and afterwards rubbed
    dry by means of coarse towels. The hard and soft brush is then
    resorted to, when the hair will be found to be wholly free from
    all encumbering oils and other impurities, and assume a glossy
    softness, equal to the most delicate silk. This process tends
    to preserve the tone and natural color of the hair, which is so
    frequently destroyed by the too constant use of caustic
    cosmetics.</p>

    <p><b>How to Soften Hands.</b>&mdash;After cleansing the hands
    with soap, rub them well with oatmeal while wet.</p>

    <p><b>How to Remove Stains from Hands.</b>&mdash;Damp the hands
    first in water, then rub them with tartaric acid, or salt of
    lemons, as you would with soap; rinse them and rub them dry.
    Tartaric acid, or salt of lemons, will quickly remove stains
    from white muslin or linen. Put less than half a teaspoonful of
    salt or acid into a tablespoonful of water; wet the stain with
    it, and lay it in the sun for an hour; wet it once or twice
    with cold water during the time; if this does not quite remove
    it, repeat the acid water, and lay it in the sun.</p>

    <p><b>How to Whiten Hands.</b>&mdash;1. Stir 1/4 of a pound of
    Castile soap, and place it in a jar near the fire, pour over it
    1/2 pint of alcohol; when the soap is dissolved and mixed with
    the spirit, add 1 ounce of glycerine, the same of oil of
    almonds, with a few drops of essence of violets, or ottar of
    roses, then pour it into moulds to cool for use. 2. A
    wineglassful of eau-de-cologne, and one of lemon-juice, two
    cakes of broken Windsor soap, mixed well together, when hard,
    will form an excellent substance.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Scurf in the Head.</b>&mdash;A simple and
    effectual remedy. Into a pint of water drop a lump of fresh
    quick lime, the size of a walnut; let it stand all night, then
    pour the water off clear from the sediment or deposit, add 1/4
    of a pint of the best vinegar, and wash the head with the
    mixture. Perfectly harmless; only wet the roots of the
    hair.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Chapped Lips.</b>&mdash;Take 2 ounces of
    white wax, 1 ounce of spermaceti, 4 ounces of oil of almonds, 2
    ounces of honey, 1/4 of an ounce of essence of bergamot, or any
    other scent. Melt the wax and spermaceti; then add the honey,
    and melt all together, and when hot add the almond oil by
    degrees, stirring till cold. 2. Take oil of almonds 3 ounces;
    spermaceti 1/2 ounce; virgin rice, 1/2 ounce. Melt these
    together over a slow fire, mixing with them a little powder of
    alkane root to color it. Keep stirring till cold, and then add
    a few drops of the oil of rhodium. 3.</p>

    <p>Take oil of almonds, spermaceti, white wax. and white sugar
    candy, equal parts. These form a good, white lip salve.</p>

    <p><b>How to Remove Moth Patches.</b>&mdash;Wash the patches
    with solution of common bicarbonate of soda and water several
    times during the day for two days, or until the patches are
    removed, which will usually be in forty-eight hours. After the
    process wash with some nice toilet soap, and the skin will be
    left nice, smooth and clear of patches.</p>

    <p><b>How to Take Care of the Nails.</b>&mdash;The nails should
    be kept clean by the daily use of the nail brush and soap and
    water. After wiping the hands, but while they are still soft
    from the action of the water, gently push back the skin which
    is apt to grow over the nails, which will not only preserve
    them neatly rounded, but will prevent the skin from cracking
    around their roots (nail springs), and becoming sore. The
    points of the nail should be pared at least once a week; biting
    them should be avoided.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Hiccough.</b>&mdash;A convulsive motion of
    the diaphragm and parts adjacent. The common causes are
    flatuency, indigestion, acidity and worms. It may usually be
    removed by the exhibition of warm carminatives, cordials, cold
    wafer, weak spirits, camphor julep, or spirits of sal volatile.
    A sudden fright or surprise will often produce the like effect.
    An instance is recorded of a delicate young lady that was
    troubled with hiccough for some months, and who was reduced to
    a state of extreme debility from the loss of sleep occasioned
    thereby, who was cured by a fright, after medicines and topical
    applications had failed. A pinch of snuff, a glass of cold
    soda-water, or an ice-cream, will also frequently remove this
    complaint.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Hoarseness.</b>&mdash;Make a strong tea of
    horseradish and yellow dock root, sweetened with honey and
    drink freely.</p>

    <p><b>Remedies for Hoarseness.</b>&mdash;Take one drachm of
    freshly scraped horse-radish root, to be infused with four
    ounces of water in a close vessel for three hours, and made
    into a syrup, with double its quantity of vinegar. A
    teaspoonful has often proved effectual.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Humors.</b>&mdash;Take equal parts of saffron
    and seneca snake root, make a strong tea, drink one half-pint a
    day, and this will drive out all humors from the system.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Hysterics.</b>&mdash;Take the leaves of
    motherwort and thoroughwort, and the bark of poplar root; equal
    parts. Mix them in molasses, and take four of them when the
    first symptoms of disorder are felt, and they will effectually
    check it.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Barber's Itch.</b>&mdash;Moisten the parts
    affected with saliva (spittle) and rub it over thoroughly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"
       id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span> times a day with the ashes of
       a good Havana cigar. This is a simple remedy, yet it has
       cured the most obstinate cases.</p>

    <p><b>Itch Ointment.</b>&mdash;1. Take lard, one pound; suet,
    one pound; sugar of lead, eight ounces; vermillion, two ounces.
    Mix. Scent with a little bergamot. 2. Take bichloride of
    mercury, one ounce; lard, one pound; suet, one pound;
    hydrochloride acid, one and a half ounces. Melt and well mix,
    and when perfectly cold, stir in essence of lemon, four
    drachms; essence of bergamot, one drachm. 3. Take powdered
    chloride of lime, one ounce; lard, one pound. Mix well, then
    add essence of lemon, two drachms. 4. Take bichloride of
    mercury, one part; lard, fifteen parts. Mix well together. 5.
    Take white precipitate, one part; lard, twelve parts. Mix. A
    portion of either of these ointments must be well rubbed on the
    parts affected, night and morning.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Seven-Year Itch.</b>&mdash;1. Use plenty of
    castile soap and water, and then apply freely iodide of sulphur
    ointment; or take any given quantity of simple sulphur ointment
    and color it to a light brown or chocolate color with the
    subcarbonate of iron, and then perfume it. Apply this freely,
    and if the case should be a severe one, administer mild
    alteratives in conjunction with the outward application. 2. The
    sulphur bath is a good remedy for itch or any other kind of
    skin diseases. Leprosy (the most obstinate of all) has been
    completely cured by it, and the common itch only requires two
    or three applications to completely eradicate it from the
    system. 3. Benzine, it is said, will effect a complete cure for
    scabies in the course of half to three-quarters of an hour,
    after which the patient should take a warm bath from twenty to
    thirty minutes.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Jaundice.</b>&mdash;1. Take the whites of two
    hen's eggs, beat them up well in a gill of water; take of this
    a little every morning; it will soon do good. It also creates
    an appetite, and strengthens the stomach. 2. Take of black
    cherry-tree bark, two ounces; blood root and gold thread, each
    half an ounce; put in a pint of brandy. Dose, from a
    teaspoonful to a tablespoonful morning and night.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Stiffened Joints.</b>&mdash;Take of the bark
    of white oak and sweet apple trees, equal parts; boil them down
    to a thick substance, and then add the same quantity of
    goose-grease or oil, simmer all together, and then rub it on
    the parts warm.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Kidney Disease.</b>&mdash;Equal parts of the
    oil of red cedar and the oil of spearmint.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Lame Back.</b>&mdash;Take the berries of red
    cedar and allow them to simmer in neatsfoot oil, and use as an
    ointment.</p>

    <p><b>How to Kill Lice.</b>&mdash;All kinds of lice and their
    nits may be got rid of by washing with a simple decoction of
    stavesacre (<i>Delphinium staphisagria</i>), or with a lotion
    made with the bruised seed in vinegar, or with the tincture, or
    by rubbing in a salve made with the seeds and four times their
    weight of lard very carefully beaten together. The acetic
    solution and the tincture are the cleanliest and most agreeable
    preparations, but all are equally efficacious in destroying
    both the creatures and their eggs, and even in relieving the
    intolerable itching which their casual presence leaves behind
    on many sensitive skins. The alkaloid delphinia may also be
    employed, but possesses no advantage except in the preparation
    of an ointment, when from any reason that form of application
    should be preferred.</p>

    <p><b>Rheumatic Liniment.</b>&mdash;Olive oil, spirits of
    camphor and chloroform, of each two ounces; sassafras oil, 1
    drachm. Add the oil of sassafras to the olive oil, then the
    spirits of camphor, and shake well before putting in the
    chloroform; shake when used, and keep it corked, as the
    chloroform evaporates very fast if it is left open. Apply three
    or four times daily, rubbing in well, and always toward the
    body.</p>

    <p><b>Sore Throat Liniment.</b>&mdash;Gum camphor, two ounces;
    castile soap, shaved fine, one drachm; oil of turpentine and
    oil of origanum, each one-half ounce; opium, one-fourth of an
    ounce; alcohol, one pint. In a week or ten days they will be
    fit for use. Bathe the parts freely two or three times daily
    until relief is obtained.</p>

    <p><b>A Wonderful Liniment.</b>&mdash;Two ounces oil of spike,
    two ounces origanum, two ounces hemlock, two ounces wormwood,
    four ounces sweet oil, two ounces spirit of ammonia, two ounces
    gum camphor, two ounces spirits turpentine. Add one quart
    strong alcohol. Mix well together, and bottle tight. This is an
    unequaled horse liniment, and of the best ever made for human
    ailments such as rheumatism, sprains, etc.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Sore Lips.</b>&mdash;Wash the lips with a
    strong tea, made from the bark of the white oak.</p>

    <p><b>Liver Complaint.</b>&mdash;Make a strong tea of syrup of
    burdock, wormwood and dandelion, equal parts, and drink
    freely.</p>

    <p><b>Lock Jaw.</b>&mdash;It is said that the application of
    warm lye, made of ashes as strong as possible, to a wounded
    part, will prevent a locked jaw; if a foot or hand, immerse in
    it; if another part of the body, bathe with flannels wrung out
    of the warm lye.</p>

    <p><b>Mumps.</b>&mdash;This disease, most common among
    children, begins with soreness and stiffness in the side of the
    neck. Soon a swelling of the parotid gland takes place, which
    is painful, and continues to increase for four or five days,
    sometimes making it difficult to swallow, or open the mouth.
    The swelling sometimes comes on one side at a time, but
    commonly upon both. There is often heat, and sometimes fever,
    with a dry skin, quick pulse, furred tongue, constipated bowls,
    and scanty and high-colored urine. The disease is contagious.
    The treatment is very simple&mdash;a mild diet, gentle
    laxative, occasional hot fomentations, and wearing a piece of
    flannel round the throat.</p>

    <p><b>How to Prevent Ingrowing Nails.</b>&mdash;If the nail of
    your toe be hard, and apt to grow round, and into the corners
    of your toe, take a piece of broken glass and scrape the top
    very thin; do this whenever you cut your nails, and by constant
    use it makes the corners fly up and grow flat, so that it is
    impossible they should give you any pain.</p>

    <p><b>How to Whiten Nails.</b>&mdash;The best wash for
    whitening the nails is two drachms of diluted sulphuric acid,
    one drachm of tincture of myrrh, added to four ounces of spring
    water; first cleanse the hands, and then apply the wash.</p>

    <p><b>Sure Cure for Neuralgia.</b>&mdash;1. Fill a tight-top
    thimble with cotton wool, and drop on it a few drops of strong
    spirits of hartshorn. The open mouth of the thimble is then
    applied over the seat of pain for a minute or two, until the
    skin is blistered. The skin is then rubbed off, and upon the
    denuded surface a small quantity of morphia (one-fourth grain)
    is applied. This affords almost instant relief. A second
    application of the morphia, if required, is to be preceded by
    first rubbing off the new formation that has sprung up over the
    former blistered surface.</p>

    <p>2. Dr. J. Knox Hodge recommends the following as an
    application which will relieve facial or any other neuralgia
    almost instantaneously: Albumen of egg, one drachm; rhigolene,
    four ounces; oil of peppermint, two ounces; colodion and
    chloroform, each one ounce. Mix. Agitate occasionally for
    twenty-four hours, and by gelatinization a beautiful and
    semi-solidified, opodeldoc-looking compound
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"
       id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span> which will retain its
       consistency and hold the ingredients intimately blended for
       months. Apply by smart friction with the hand, or gently
       with a soft brush or mop along the course of the nerve
       involved.</p>

    <p>3. Mix one and one-half drachms iodide of potash, fifteen
    grains of quinine and one ounce ginger syrup, and two and a
    half ounces water. Dose, a tablespoonful every three hours.</p>

    <p>4. <b>Of the Stomach.</b>&mdash;Take of distilled water of
    cherry laurel, five parts; muriate of morphia, one-tenth part.
    Mix and dissolve. One drop on a lump of sugar immediately
    before meals.</p>

    <p><b>Ointment for Sore Nipples.</b>&mdash;Glycerine, rose
    water and tannin, equal weights, rubbed together into an
    ointment, is very highly recommended for sore or cracked
    nipples.</p>

    <p><b>Glycerine Ointment.</b>&mdash;Melt together spermaceti,
    two drachms; white wax, one-half drachm; oil of sweet almonds,
    two ounces, and then add glycerine, one ounce, and stir briskly
    until cool. An admirable application for chapped hands,
    etc.</p>

    <p><b>Ointment for Itch.</b>&mdash;- White precipitate, fifteen
    grains; saltpetre, one-half drachm; flour of sulphur, one
    drachm; Mix well with lard, two ounces. Long celebrated for the
    cure of itch.</p>

    <p><b>Sulphur Ointment.</b>&mdash;Flour of sulphur, eight
    ounces; oil of bergamot, two drachms; lard, one pound. Rub
    freely three times a day, for itch.</p>

    <p><b>Ointment for Piles.</b>&mdash;Tannin, two drachms; water,
    two fluid drachms; triturate together, and add lard, one and a
    half drachms. An excellent application for piles.</p>

    <p><b>Ointment for Hemorrhoids.</b>&mdash;Sulphate of morphia,
    three grains; extract of stramonia, thirty grains; olive oil,
    one drachm; carbonate of lead, sixty grains; lard, three
    drachms.</p>

    <p><b>Pains.</b>&mdash;1. Steep marigold in good cider vinegar
    and frequently wash the affected parts. This will afford speedy
    relief.</p>

    <p>2. Take half a pound of tar and the same quantity of
    tobacco, and boil them down separately to a thick substance;
    then simmer them together. Spread a plaster and apply it to the
    affected parts, and it will afford immediate relief.</p>

    <p><b>Painters' Colic.</b>&mdash;Make of tartaric acid a syrup
    similar to that of lemon syrup; add a sufficient quantity of
    water, and drink two or three glasses a day.</p>

    <p><b>Instantaneous Pain-Killer.</b>&mdash;Another and even
    more instant cure of pain is made as follows: Take
    aqua-ammonia, sulphuric ether and alcohol, equal parts, and
    apply over the pain.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Pimples.</b>&mdash;Take a teaspoonful of the
    tincture of gum guaiacum and one teaspoonful of vinegar; mix
    well and apply to the affected parts.</p>

    <p><b>Poor Man's Plaster.</b>&mdash;Melt together beeswax, one
    ounce; tar, three ounces; resin, three ounces, and spread on
    paper or muslin.</p>

    <p><b>Rheumatic Plaster.</b>&mdash;One-fourth pound of resin
    and one-fourth pound of sulphur; melt by a slow fire, and add
    one ounce of Cayenne pepper and one-fourth of an ounce of
    camphor gum; stir well till mixed, and temper with neatsfoot
    oil.</p>

    <p><b>Strengthening Plaster.</b>&mdash;Litharge plasters,
    twenty-four parts; white resin, six parts; yellow wax and olive
    oil, of each three parts, and red oxide of iron, eight parts.
    Let the oxide be rubbed with the oil, and the other ingredients
    added melted, and mix the whole well together. The plaster,
    after being spread over the leather, should be cut into strips
    two inches wide and strapped firmly around the joint.</p>

    <p><b>Mustard Plasters.</b>&mdash;It is stated that in making a
    mustard plaster, no water whatever should be used, but the
    mustard mixed with the white of an egg; the result will be a
    plaster that will "draw" perfectly, but will not produce a
    blister even upon the skin of an infant, no matter how long it
    is allowed to remain upon the part.</p>

    <p><b>Bread and Milk Poultice.</b>&mdash;Take stale bread in
    crumbs, pour boiling sweet milk, or milk and water over it, and
    simmer till soft, stirring it well; then take it from the fire,
    and gradually stir in a little glycerine or sweet oil, so as to
    render the poultice pliable when applied.</p>

    <p><b>Linseed Poultice.</b>&mdash;- Take of linseed, powdered,
    four ounces; hot water sufficient, mix and stir well with a
    spoon, until of suitable consistence. A little oil should be
    added, and some smeared over the surface as well, to prevent
    its getting hard. A very excellent poultice, suitable for many
    purposes.</p>

    <p><b>Spice Poultice.</b>&mdash;Powdered cinnamon, cloves and
    Cayenne pepper, of each two ounces; rye meal, or flour, spirits
    and honey, of each sufficient to make of suitable
    consistence.</p>

    <p><b>Quinsy.</b>&mdash;This is an inflammation of the tonsils,
    or common inflammatory sore throat; commences with a slight
    feverish attack, with considerable pain and swelling of the
    tonsils, causing some difficulty in swallowing; as the attack
    advances these symptoms become more intense, there is headache,
    thirst, a painful sense of tension, and acute darting pains in
    the ears. The attack is generally brought on by exposure to
    cold, and lasts from five to seven days, when it subsides
    naturally, or an abscess may form in tonsils and burst, or the
    tonsil may remain enlarged, the inflammation subsiding.</p>

    <p>TREATMENT.&mdash;The patient should remain in a warm room,
    the diet chiefly milk and good broths, some cooling laxative
    and diaphoretic medicine may be given; but the greatest relief
    will be found in the frequent inhalation of the steam of hot
    water through an inhaler, or in the old-fashioned way, through
    the spout of a teapot.</p>

    <p><b>Other Remedies for Rheumatism.</b>&mdash;1. Bathe the
    parts affected with water in which potatoes have been boiled,
    as hot as can be borne, just before going to bed; by morning it
    will be much relieved, if not removed. One application of this
    simple remedy has cured the most obstinate of rheumatic pains.
    2. Half an ounce of pulverized salt petre put in half a pint of
    sweet oil; bathe the parts affected, and a sound cure will be
    speedily effected. 3. Rheumatism has frequently been cured by a
    persistent use of lemon juice, either undiluted or in the form
    of lemonade. Suck half a lemon every morning before breakfast,
    and occasionally during the day, and partake of lemonade when
    thirsty in preference to any other drink. If severely afflicted
    a physician should be consulted, but, in all cases, lemon juice
    will hasten the cure. 4. By the valerian bath, made simply by
    taking one pound of valerian root, boiling it gently for about
    a quarter of an hour in one gallon of water, straining and
    adding the strained liquid to about twenty gallons of water in
    an ordinary bath. The temperature should be about ninety-eight
    degrees, and the time of immersion from twenty minutes to half
    an hour. Pains must be taken to dry the patient perfectly upon
    getting out of the bath. If the inflammation remain refractory
    in any of the joints, linseed meal poultices should be made
    with a strong decoction of valerian root and applied.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Ring-Worm.</b>&mdash;To one part sulphuric
    acid, add sixteen to twenty parts water. Use a brush and
    feather, and apply it to the parts night and morning. A few
    dressings will generally cure. If the solution is too
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"
       id="page91"></a>[pg 91]</span> and causes pain, dilute it
       with water, and if the irritation is excessive, rub on a
       little oil or other softening application, but always avoid
       the use of soap.</p>

    <p>Or, wash the head with soft soap every morning, and apply
    the following lotion every night: One-half drachm of
    sub-carbonate of soda dissolved in one gill of vinegar.</p>

    <p><b>Healing Salve.</b>&mdash;Sweet oil, three quarts; resin,
    three ounces; beeswax, three ounces. Melt together; then add
    powdered red lead, two pounds; heat all these together and when
    nearly cold add a piece of camphor as large as a nutmeg. Good
    for burns, etc.</p>

    <p><b>Salt Rheum.</b>&mdash;1. Make a strong tea of elm root
    bark; drink the tea freely, and wash the affected part in the
    same. 2. Take one ounce of blue flag root, steep it in half a
    pint of gin; take a teaspoonful three times a day, morning,
    noon and night, and wash with the same. 3. Take one ounce of
    oil of tar, one drachm of oil of checker berry; mix. Take from
    five to twenty drops morning and night as the stomach will
    bear.</p>

    <p><b>Bleeding of the Stomach.</b>&mdash;Take a teaspoonful of
    camomile tea every ten minutes until the bleeding stops.</p>

    <p><b>Sickness of Stomach.</b>&mdash;Drink three or four times
    a day of the steep made from the bark of white poplar
    roots.</p>

    <p><b>Sunburn and Tan.</b>&mdash;1. Take two drachms of borax,
    one drachm of Roman alum, one drachm of camphor, half an ounce
    of sugar candy, and a pound of ox-gall. Mix, and stir well for
    ten minutes or so, and repeat this stirring three or four times
    a day for a fortnight, till it appears clear and transparent.
    Strain through blotting paper, and bottle up for use. 2. Milk
    of almonds made thus: Take of blanched bitter almonds half an
    ounce, soft water half a pint; make an emulsion by beating the
    almonds and water together, strain through a muslin cloth, and
    it is made. 3. A preparation composed of equal parts of olive
    oil and lime water is also an excellent remedy for sunburn.</p>

    <p><b>To Produce Sweat.</b>&mdash;Take of nitre, one-half
    drachm; snake's head (herb), saffron, camphor, snake-root,
    seneca, bark of sassafras root, each one ounce; ipecac, and
    opium, each one half ounce; put the above in three quarts of
    Holland gin, and take a tablespoonful in catnip tea every few
    minutes, till a sweat is produced.</p>

    <p><b>Teething.</b>&mdash;Young children whilst cutting their
    first set of teeth often suffer severe constitutional
    disturbance. At first there is restlessness and peevishness,
    with slight fever, but not infrequently these are followed by
    convulsive fits, as they are commonly called, which depends on
    the brain becoming irritated; and sometimes under this
    condition the child is either cut off suddenly, or the
    foundation of serious mischief to the brain is laid. The
    remedy, or rather the safeguard, against these frightful
    consequences is trifling, safe, and almost certain, and
    consists merely in lancing the gum covering the tooth which is
    making its making its way through. When teething is about it
    may be known by the spittle constantly driveling from the mouth
    and wetting the frock. The child has its fingers in its month,
    and bites hard any substance it can get hold of. If the gums be
    carefully looked at, the part where the tooth is pressing up is
    swollen and redder than usual; and if the finger be pressed on
    it the child shrinks and cries, showing that the gum is tender.
    When these symptoms occur, the gum should be lanced, and
    sometimes the tooth comes through the next day, if near the
    surface; but if not so far advanced the cut heals and a scar
    forms, which is thought by some objectionable, as rendering the
    passage of the tooth more difficult. This, however, is untrue,
    for the scar will give way much more easily than the uncut gum.
    If the tooth does not come through after two or three days, the
    lancing may be repeated; and this is more especially needed if
    the child be very fractious, and seems in much pain. Lancing
    the gums is further advantageous, because it empties the
    inflamed part of its blood, and so relieves the pain and
    inflammation. The relief children experience in the course of
    two or three hours from the operation is often very remarkable,
    as they almost immediately become lively and cheerful.</p>

    <p><b>Wash for Teeth and Gums.</b>&mdash;The teeth should be
    washed night and morning, a moderately small and soft brush
    being used; after the morning ablution, pour on a second
    tooth-brush, slightly dampened, a little of the following
    lotion: Carbolic acid, 20 drops; spirits of wine, 2 drachms;
    distilled water, 6 ounces. After using this lotion a short time
    the gums become firmer and less tender, and impurity of the
    breath (which is most commonly caused by bad teeth), will be
    removed. It is a great mistake to use hard tooth-brushes, or to
    brush the teeth until the gums bleed.</p>

    <p><b>Tetter.</b>&mdash;After a slight feverish attack, lasting
    two or three days, clusters of small, transparent pimples,
    filled sometimes with a colorless, sometimes with a brownish
    lymph, appear on the cheeks or forehead, or on the extremities,
    and at times on the body. The pimples are about the size of a
    pea, and break after a few days, when a brown or yellow crust
    is formed over them, which falls off about the tenth day,
    leaving the skin red and irritable. The eruption is attended
    with heat; itching, tingling, fever, and restlessness,
    especially at night. Ringworm is a curious form of tetter, in
    which the inflamed patches assume the form of a ring.</p>

    <p>TREATMENT&mdash;Should consist of light diet, and gentle
    laxatives. If the patient be advanced in life, and feeble, a
    tonic will be desirable. For a wash, white vitriol, 1 drachm;
    rose-water, 3 ounces, mixed; or an ointment made of
    alder-flower ointment, 1 ounce; oxide of zinc, 1 drachm.</p>

    <p><b>To Remove Tan.</b>&mdash;Tan may be removed from the face
    by mixing magnesia in soft water to the consistency of paste,
    which should then be spread on the face and allowed to remain a
    minute or two. Then wash off with Castile soap suds, and rinse
    with soft water.</p>

    <p><b>Care of the Teeth.</b>&mdash;The mouth has a temperature
    of 98 degrees, warmer than is ever experienced in the shade in
    the latitude of New England. It is well known that if beef, for
    example, be exposed in the shade during the warmest of our
    summer days, it will very soon decompose. If we eat beef for
    dinner, the particles invariably find their way into the spaces
    between the teeth. Now, if these particles of beef are not
    removed, they will frequently remain till they are softened by
    decomposition. In most mouths this process of decomposition is
    in constant progress. Ought we to be surprised that the gums
    and teeth against which these decomposing or putrefying masses
    lie should become subjects of disease?</p>

    <p>How shall our teeth be preserved? The answer is very
    simple&mdash;keep them very clean. How shall they be kept
    clean? Answer&mdash;By a toothpick, rinsing with water, and the
    daily use of a brush.</p>

    <p>The toothpick should be a quill, not because the metalic
    picks injure the enamel, but because the quill pick is so
    flexible it fits into all the irregularities between the teeth.
    Always after using the toothpick the mouth should be thoroughly
    rinsed. If warm water be not at hand, cold may be used,
    although warm is much better. Closing the lips, with a motion
    familiar to all, everything may be thoroughly rinsed from the
    mouth.</p>

    <p>Every morning (on rising), and every evening (on going to
    bed), the tooth-brush should be used, and the teeth, both
    outside and inside, thoroughly brushed.</p>

    <p>Much has been said <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>., upon the use
    of soap with the tooth-brush. My own experience and the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"
       id="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span> of members of my family is
       highly favorable to the regular morning and evening use of
       soap. Castile or other good soap will answer this purpose.
       (Whatever is good for the hands and face is good for the
       teeth.) The slightly unpleasant taste which soap has when we
       begin to use it will soon be unnoticed.</p>

    <p><b>Tooth Powders.</b>&mdash;Many persons, while laudably
    attentive to the preservation of their teeth, do them harm by
    too much officiousness. They daily apply to them some
    dentifrice powder, which they rub so hard as not only to injure
    the enamel by excessive friction, but to hurt the gums even
    more than by the abuse of the toothpick. The quality of some of
    the dentifrice powders advertised in newspapers is extremely
    suspicious, and there is reason to think that they are not
    altogether free from a corrosive ingredient. One of the safest
    and best compositions for the purpose is a mixture of two parts
    of prepared chalk, one of Peruvian bark, and one of hard soap,
    all finely powdered, which is calculated not only to clean the
    teeth without hurting them, but to preserve the firmness of the
    gums.</p>

    <p>Besides the advantage of sound teeth for their use in
    mastication, a proper attention to their treatment conduces not
    a little to the sweetness of the breath. This is, indeed, often
    affected by other causes existing in the lungs, the stomach,
    and sometimes even in the bowels, but a rotten state of the
    teeth, both from the putrid smell emitted by carious bones and
    the impurities lodged in their cavities, never fails of
    aggravating an unpleasant breath wherever there is a tendency
    of that kind.</p>

    <p><b>Remedies for Toothache.</b>&mdash;1. One drachm of alum
    reduced to an impalpable powder, three drachms of nitrous
    spirits of ether&mdash;mix, and apply them to the tooth on
    cotton. 2. Mix a little salt and alum, equal portions, grind it
    fine, wet a little lock of cotton, fill it with the powder and
    put it in your tooth. One or two applications seldom fail to
    cure. 3. To one drachm of collodion add two drachms of
    Calvert's carbolic acid. A gelatinous mass is precipitated, a
    small portion of which, inserted in the cavity of an aching
    tooth, invariably gives immediate relief. 4. Saturate a small
    bit of clean cotton wool with a strong solution of ammonia, and
    apply it immediately to the affected tooth. The pleasing
    contrast immediately produced in some cases causes fits of
    laughter, although a moment previous extreme suffering and
    anguish prevailed. 5. Sometimes a sound tooth aches from
    sympathy of the nerves of the face with other nerves. But when
    toothache proceeds from a decayed tooth either have it taken
    out, or put hot fomentations upon the face, and hot drinks into
    the mouth, such as tincture of cayenne.</p>

    <p><b>To Cure Warts.</b>&mdash;Warts are formed by the small
    arteries, veins, and nerves united together, taking on a
    disposition to grow by extending themselves upward, carrying
    the scarf-skin along with them, which, thickening, forms a
    wart. Corns are a similar growth, brought about by the friction
    of tight boots and shoes. 1. Take a piece of diachylon plaster,
    cut a hole in the centre the size of the wart, and stick it on,
    the wart protruding through. Then touch it daily with
    aquafortis, or nitrate of silver. They may be removed by tying
    a string tightly around them. 2. Take a blacksmith's punch,
    heat it red hot and burn the warts with the end of it. When the
    burn gets well the warts will be gone forever. 3. Scrape down
    enough dry cobwebs to make a ball large enough to, or a little
    more than, cover the wart and not touch the flesh around the
    same; lay it on top of the wart, ignite it and let it be until
    it is all burnt up. The wart will turn white, and in a few days
    come out. 4. Pass a pin through the wart; apply one end of the
    pin to the flame of a lamp; hold it there until the wart fries
    under the action of the heat. A wart so treated will leave. 5.
    Dissolve as much common washing soda as the water will take up;
    wash the warts with this for a minute or two, and let them dry
    without wiping. Keep the water in a bottle and repeat the
    washing often, and it will take away the largest warts. 6. They
    may be cured surely by paring them down until the blood comes
    slightly and then rubbing them with lunar caustic. It is
    needless to say this hurts a little, but it is a sure cure. The
    hydrochlorate of lime applied in the same way will cure after
    several applications and some patience; so will strong good
    vinegar, and so it is said will milk weed. The cures founded
    upon superstitious practices, such as muttering some phrases
    over the excrescence, stealing a piece of beef, rubbing the
    wart therewith and then burying it under the leaves to await
    its decay, etc., etc., are all the remnants of a past state of
    ignorance and are of no use whatever. Warts are generally only
    temporary and disappear as their possessors grow up.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure White Swelling.</b>&mdash;Draw a blister on
    the inside of the leg below the knee; keep it running with
    ointment made of hen manure, by simmering it in hog's lard with
    onions; rub the knee with the following kind of ointment: Bits
    of peppermint, oil of sassafras, checkerberry, juniper, one
    drachm each; simmer in one-half pint neatsfoot oil, and rub on
    the knee three times a day.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Wounds.</b>&mdash;Catnip steeped, mixed with
    fresh butter and sugar.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Whooping-Cough.</b>&mdash;Take a quart of
    spring water, put in it a large handful of chin-cups that grow
    upon moss, a large handful of unset hyssop; boil it to a pint,
    strain it off, and sweeten it with sugar-candy. Let the child,
    as often as it coughs, take two spoonfuls at a time.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Worms in Children.</b>&mdash;1. Take one
    ounce of powdered snake-head (herb), and one drachm each of
    aloes and prickly ash bark; powder these, and to one-half
    teaspoonful of this powder add a teaspoonful of boiling water
    and a teaspoonful of molasses. Take this as a dose, night or
    morning, more or less, as the symptoms may require. 2. Take
    tobacco leaves, pound them up with honey, and lay them on the
    belly of the child or grown person, at the same time
    administering a dose of some good physic. 3. Take garden
    parsley, make it into a tea and let the patient drink freely of
    it. 4. Take the scales that will fall around the blacksmith's
    anvil, powder them fine, and put them in sweetened rum. Shake
    when you take them, and give a teaspoonful three times a
    day.</p>

    <p><b>Scalding of the Urine.</b>&mdash;Equal parts of the oil
    of red cedar, and the oil of spearmint.</p>

    <p><b>Urinary Obstructions.</b>&mdash;Steep pumpkin seeds in
    gin, and drink about three glasses a day; or, administer half a
    drachm uva ursi every morning, and a dose of spearmint.</p>

    <p><b>Free Passage Of Urine.</b>&mdash;The leaves of the
    currant bush made into a tea, and taken as a common drink.</p>

    <p><b>Venereal Complaints.</b>&mdash;Equal parts of the oil of
    red cedar, combined with sarsaparilla, yellow dock and burdock
    made into a syrup; add to a pint of this syrup an ounce of gum
    guiaicum. Dose, from a tablespoonful to a wine-glass, as best
    you can bear.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cure Sore Throat.</b>&mdash;"One who has tried it"
    communicates the following sensible item about curing sore
    throat: Let each one of your half million readers buy at any
    drug store one ounce of camphorated oil and five cents' worth
    of chloride of potash. Whenever any soreness appears in the
    throat, put the potash in half a tumbler of water, and with it
    gargle the throat thoroughly; then rub the neck thoroughly with
    the camphorated oil at night before going to bed, and also pin
    around the throat a small strip of woolen flannel. This is a
    simple, cheap and sure remedy.</p>

    <h2>MASTERPIECES OF ELOQUENCE</h2>

    <p>The following masterpieces of elegiac eloquence are
    unsurpassed in the repertory of the English classics, for lofty
    and noble sentiment, exquisite pathos, vivid imagery,
    tenderness of feeling, glowing power of description, brilliant
    command of language, and that immortal and seldom attained
    faculty of painting in the soul of the listener or reader a
    realistic picture whose sublimity of conception impresses the
    understanding with awe and admiration, and impels the mind to
    rise involuntarily for the time to an elevation out of and
    above the inconsequent contemplation of the common and sordid
    things of life.</p>

    <h3>AT HIS BROTHER'S GRAVE.</h3>

    <p>The following grand oration was delivered by Hon. Robert G.
    Ingersoll on the occasion of the funeral of his brother, Hon.
    Eben C. Ingersoll, in Washington, June 2:</p>

    <p>"My friends, I am going to do that which the dead oft
    promised he would do for me. The loved and loving brother,
    husband, father, friend, died where manhood's morning almost
    touches noon, and while the shadows were still falling towards
    the west. He had not passed on life's highway the stone that
    marks the highest point, but being weary for a moment he lay
    down by the wayside, and using his burden for a pillow fell
    into that dreamless sleep that kisses down the eyelids. Still,
    while yet in love with life and raptured with the world, he
    passed to silence and pathetic dust. Yet, after all, it may be
    best, just in the happiest, sunniest hour of all the voyage,
    while eager winds are kissing every sail, to dash against the
    unseen rock and in an instant to hear the billows roar, 'A
    sunken ship;' for whether in mid-sea or among the breakers of
    the farther shore, a wreck must mark at last the end of each
    and all, and every life, no matter if its every hour is rich
    with love, and every moment jeweled with a joy, will at its
    close become a tragedy as sad and deep and dark as can be woven
    of the warp and woof of mystery and death. This brave and
    tender man in every storm of life was oak and rock, but in the
    sunshine he was vine and flower. He was the friend of all
    heroic souls. He climbed the heights and left all superstitions
    far below, while on his forehead fell the golden dawning of a
    grander day. He loved the beautiful, and was with color, form
    and music touched to tears. He sided with the weak, and with a
    willing hand gave alms. With loyal heart, and with the purest
    hand he faithfully discharged all public trusts. He was a
    worshiper of liberty and a friend of the oppressed. A thousand
    times I have heard him quote the words, 'For Justice all place
    temple, and all seasons summer.' He believed that happiness was
    the only good, reason the only torch, justice the only
    worshiper, humanity the only religion, and love the priest. He
    added to the sum of human joy, and were everyone for whom he
    did some loving service to bring a blossom to his grave, he
    would sleep to-night beneath a wilderness of flowers. Life is a
    narrow vale between the cold and barren peaks of two
    eternities. We strive in vain to look beyond the heights. We
    cry aloud, and the only answer is the echo of our wailing cry.
    From the voiceless lips of the unreplying dead there comes no
    word, but the light of death. Hope sees a star, and listening
    love can hear the rustic of a wing, lie who sleeps here when
    dying, mistaking the approach of death for the return of
    health, whispered with his latest breath, 'I am better now.'
    Let us believe, in spite of doubts and dogmas, and tears and
    fears, that these dear words are true of all the countless
    dead. And now, to you who have been chosen from among the many
    men he loved to do the last sad office for the dead, we give
    his sacred dust. Speech cannot contain our love. There was,
    there is, no gentler, stronger, manlier man."</p>

    <h3>AT THE GRAVE OF A CHILD.</h3>

    <p>Colonel Ingersoll upon one occasion was one of a little
    party of sympathizing friends who had gathered in a drizzling
    rain to assist the sorrowing friends of a young boy&mdash;a
    bright and stainless flower, cut off in the bloom of its beauty
    and virgin purity by the ruthless north winds from the
    Plutonian shades&mdash;in the last sad office of committing the
    poor clay to the bosom of its mother earth. Inspired by that
    true sympathy of the great heart of a great man, Colonel
    Ingersoll stepped to the side of the grave and spoke as
    follows:</p>

    <p>"My friends, I know how vain it is to gild grief with words,
    and yet I wish to take from every grave its fear. Here in this
    world, where life and death are equal king, all should be brave
    enough to meet what all the dead have met. The future has been
    filled with fear, stained and polluted by the heartless past.
    From the wondrous tree of life the buds and blossoms fall with
    ripened fruit, and in the common bed of earth the patriarchs
    and babes sleep side by side. Why should we fear that which
    will come to all that is? We cannot tell; we do not know which
    is the greater blessing&mdash;life or death. We cannot say that
    death is not a good; we do not know whether the grave is the
    end of this life or the door of another, or whether the night
    here is not somewhere else a dawn. Neither can we
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"
       id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span> which is the more fortunate,
       the child dying in its mother's arms, before its lips have
       learned to form a word, or he who journeys all the length of
       life's uneven road, taking the last slow steps painfully
       with staff and crutch. Every cradle asks us 'whence,' and
       every coffin 'whither?' The poor barbarian, weeping above
       his dead, can answer these questions as intelligently and
       satisfactorily as the robed priest of the most authentic
       creed. The tearful ignorance of the one is just as good as
       the learned and unmeaning words of the other. No man,
       standing where the horizon of life has touched a grave, has
       any right to prophesy a future filled with pain and tears.
       It may be that death gives all there is of worth to live. If
       those we press and strain against our hearts could never
       die, perhaps that love would wither from the earth. May be
       this common fate treads from out the paths between our
       hearts the weeds of selfishness and hate, and I had rather
       live and love where death is king, than have eternal life
       where love is not. Another life is naught, unless we know
       and love again the ones who love us here. They who stand
       with breaking hearts around this little grave need have no
       fear. The larger and the nobler faith in all that is and is
       to be, tells us that death, even at its worst, is only
       perfect rest. We know that through the common wants of life,
       the needs and duties of each hour, their grief will lessen
       day by day, until at last these graves will be to them a
       place of rest and peace, almost of joy. There is for them
       this consolation, the dead do not suffer. If they live
       again, their lives will surely be as good as ours. We have
       no fear; we are all the children of the same mother, and the
       same fate awaits us all. We, too, have our religion, and it
       is this: 'Help for the living; hope for the dead.'"</p>

    <h2>THEMES FOR DEBATE.</h2>

    <p>Following are one hundred and fifty topics for debate. The
    more usual form in their presentation is that of a direct
    proposition or statement, rather than that of a question. The
    opponents then debate the "affirmative" and "negative" of the
    proposition. It is well to be very careful, in adopting a
    subject for a debate, to so state or explain it that
    misunderstandings may be mutually avoided, and quibbles on the
    meaning of words prevented.</p>

    <h2>COOKERY RECIPES</h2>

    <p><b>Ale to Mull.</b>&mdash;Take a pint of good strong ale,
    and pour it into a saucepan with three cloves and a little
    nutmeg; sugar to your taste. Set it over the fire, and when it
    boils take it off to cool. Beat up the yolks of four eggs
    exceedingly well; mix them first with a little cold ale, then
    add them to the warm ale, and pour it in and out of the pan
    several times. Set it over a slow fire, beat it a little, take
    it off again; do this three times until it is hot, then serve
    it with dry toast.</p>

    <p><b>Ale, Spiced.</b>&mdash;Is made hot, sweetened with sugar
    and spiced with grated nutmeg, and a hot toast is served in it.
    This is the wassail drink.</p>

    <p><b>Beef Tea.</b>&mdash;Cut a pound of fleshy beef in thin
    slices; simmer with a quart of water twenty minutes, after it
    has once boiled and been skimmed. Season if approved.</p>

    <p><b>Beef Tea.</b>&mdash;To one pound of lean beef add one and
    one-half tumblers of cold water; cut the beef in small pieces,
    cover, and let it boil slowly for ten minutes, and add a little
    salt after it is boiled. Excellent.</p>

    <p><b>Beef Tea.</b>&mdash;Cut lean, tender beef into small
    pieces, put them into a bottle, cork and set in a pot of cold
    water, then put on the stove and boil for one hour. Season to
    taste.</p>

    <p><b>Black Currant Cordial.</b>&mdash;To every four quarts of
    black currants, picked from the stems and lightly bruised, add
    one gallon of the best whisky; let it remain four months,
    shaking the jar occasionally, then drain off the liquor and
    strain. Add three pounds of loaf sugar and a quarter of a pound
    of best cloves, slightly bruised; bottle well and seal.</p>

    <p><b>Boston Cream (a Summer Drink).</b>&mdash;Make a syrup of
    four pounds of white sugar with four quarts of water; boil;
    when cold add four ounces of tartaric acid, one and a half
    ounces of essence of lemon, and the whites of six eggs beaten
    to a stiff froth; bottle. A wine-glass of the cream to a
    tumbler of water, with sufficient carbonate of soda to make it
    effervesce.</p>

    <p><b>Champagne Cup.</b>&mdash;One quart bottle of champagne,
    two bottles of soda-water, one liqueur-glass of brandy, two
    tablespoons of powdered sugar, a few thin strips of cucumber
    rind; make this just in time for use, and add a large piece of
    ice.</p>

    <p><b>Chocolate.</b>&mdash;Scrape Cadbury's chocolate fine, mix
    with a little cold water and the yolks of eggs well beaten; add
    this to equal parts of milk and water, and boil well, being
    careful that it does not burn. Sweeten to the taste, and serve
    hot.</p>

    <p><b>Coffee.</b>&mdash;Is a tonic and stimulating beverage, of
    a wholesome nature. Use the best. For eight cups use nearly
    eight cups of water; put in coffee as much as you like, boil a
    minute and take off, and throw in a cup of cold water to throw
    the grounds to the bottom; in five minutes it will be very
    clear.</p>

    <p>Or, beat one or two eggs, which mix with ground coffee to
    form a ball; nearly fill the pot with cold water, simmer gently
    for half an hour, having introduced the ball; <i>do not
    boil</i>, or you will destroy the aroma.</p>

    <p><b>Coffee.</b>&mdash;The following is a delicious dish
    either for summer breakfast or dessert: Make a strong infusion
    of Mocha coffee; put it in a porcelain bowl, sugar it properly
    and add to it an equal portion of boiled milk, or one-third the
    quantity of rich cream. Surround the bowl with pounded ice.</p>

    <p><b>Currant Wine.</b>&mdash;One quart currant juice, three
    pounds of sugar, sufficient water to make a gallon.</p>

    <p><b>Egg Gruel.</b>&mdash;Boil eggs from one to three hours
    until hard enough to grate; then boil new milk and thicken with
    the egg, and add a little salt. Excellent in case of
    nausea.</p>

    <p><b>Lemon Syrup.</b>&mdash;Pare off the yellow rind of the
    lemon, slice the lemon and put a layer of lemon and a thick
    layer of sugar in a deep plate; cover close with a saucer, and
    set in a warm place. This is an excellent remedy for a
    cold.</p>

    <p><b>Lemonade.</b>&mdash;Take a quart of boiling water, and
    add to it five ounces of lump-sugar, the yellow rind of the
    lemon rubbed off with a bit of sugar, and the juice of three
    lemons. Stir all together and let it stand till cool. Two
    ounces of cream of tartar may be used instead of the lemons,
    water being poured upon it.</p>

    <p><b>Raspberry Vinegar.</b>&mdash;Fill a jar with red
    raspberries picked from the stalks. Pour in as much vinegar as
    it will hold. Let it stand ten days, then strain it through a
    sieve. Don't press the berries, just let the juice run through.
    To every pint add one pound loaf sugar. Boil it like other
    syrup; skim, and bottle when cold.</p>

    <p><b>Summer Drink.</b>&mdash;Boil together for five minutes
    two ounces of tartaric acid, two pounds white sugar, three
    lemons sliced, two quarts of water; when nearly cold add the
    whites of four eggs beaten to a froth, one tablespoonful of
    flour and half an ounce of wintergreen. Two tablespoonfuls in a
    glass of water make a pleasant drink; for those who like
    effervescence add as much soda as a ten-cent piece will hold,
    stirring it briskly before drinking.</p>

    <p><b>Blackberry Syrup.</b>&mdash;To one pint of juice put one
    pound of white sugar, one-half ounce of powdered cinnamon,
    one-fourth ounce mace, and two teaspoons cloves; boil all
    together for a quarter of an hour, then strain the syrup, and
    add to each pint a glass of French brandy.</p>

    <p><b>Tea.</b>&mdash;When the water in the teakettle begins to
    boil, have ready a tin tea-steeper; pour into the tea-steeper
    just a very little of the boiling water, and then put in tea,
    allowing one teaspoon of tea to each person. Pour over this
    boiling water until the steeper is a little more than half
    full; cover tightly and let it stand where it will keep hot,
    but not to boil. Let the tea infuse for ten or fifteen minutes,
    and then pour into the tea-urn, adding more boiling water, in
    the proportion of one cup of water for every teaspoon of dry
    tea which has been infused. Have boiling water in a water-pot,
    and weaken each cup of tea
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"
       id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span> as desired. Do not use water
       for tea that has been boiled long. Spring water is best for
       tea, and filtered water next best.</p>

    <p><b>Iced Tea a la Russe.</b>&mdash;To each glass of tea add
    the juice of half a lemon, fill up the glass with pounded ice,
    and sweeten.</p>

    <p><b>General Directions for Making Bread.</b>&mdash;In the
    composition of good bread, there are three important
    requisites: Good flour, good yeast, [and here let us recommend
    Gillett's Magic Yeast Cakes. They keep good for one year in any
    climate, and once used you will not do without it. All grocers
    keep it] and strength to knead it well. Flour should be white
    and dry, crumbling easily again after it is pressed in the
    hand.</p>

    <p>A very good method of ascertaining the quality of yeast will
    be to add a little flour to a very small quantity, setting it
    in a warm place. If in the course of ten or fifteen minutes it
    raises, it will do to use.</p>

    <p>When you make bread, first set the sponge with warm milk or
    water, keeping it in a warm place until quite light. Then mold
    this sponge, by adding flour, into one large loaf, kneading it
    well. Set this to rise again, and then when sufficiently light
    mold it into smaller loaves, let it rise again, then bake. Care
    should be taken not to get the dough too stiff with flour; it
    should be as soft as it can be to knead well. To make bread or
    biscuits a nice color, wet the dough over top with water just
    before putting it into the oven. Flour should always be
    sifted.</p>

    <p><b>Brown Bread,</b> for those who can eat corn-meal: Two
    cups Indian meal to one cup flour; one-half teacup syrup, 2-1/2
    cups milk; 1 teaspoon salt; 3 teaspoons of Gillett's baking
    powder. Steam an hour and a half. To be eaten hot. It goes very
    nicely with a corn-beef dinner.</p>

    <p><b>Brown Bread.</b>&mdash;Stir together wheat meal and cold
    water (nothing else, not even salt) to the consistency of a
    thick batter. Bake in small circular pans, from three to three
    and a half inches in diameter, (ordinary tin pattypans do very
    well) in a quick, hot oven. It is quite essential that it be
    baked in this sized cake, as it is upon this that the raising
    depends. [In this article there are none of the injurious
    qualities of either fermented or superfine flour bread; and it
    is so palpably wholesome food, that it appeals at once to the
    common sense of all who are interested in the subject.]</p>

    <p><b>Brown Bread</b>&mdash;Take part of the sponge that has
    been prepared for your white bread, warm water can be added,
    mix it with graham flour (not too stiff).</p>

    <p><b>Boston Brown Bread.</b>&mdash;To make one loaf:&mdash;Rye
    meal unsifted, half a pint; Indian meal sifted, one pint; sour
    milk, one pint; molasses, half a gill. Add a teaspoonful of
    salt, one teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little hot water;
    stir well, put in a greased pan, let it rise one hour, and
    steam four hours.</p>

    <p><b>Boston Brown Bread.</b>&mdash;One and one-half cups of
    graham flour, two cups of corn meal, one-half cup of molasses,
    one pint of sweet milk, and one-half a teaspoon of soda; steam
    three hours.</p>

    <p><b>Corn Bread.</b>&mdash;One-half pint of buttermilk,
    one-half pint of sweet milk; sweeten the sour milk with
    one-half teaspoon of soda; beat two eggs, whites and yolks
    together; pour the milk into the eggs, then thicken with about
    nine tablespoons of sifted corn meal. Put the pan on the stove
    with a piece of lard the size of an egg; when melted pour it in
    the batter; this lard by stirring it will grease the pan to
    bake in; add a teaspoon of salt.</p>

    <p><b>Excellent Bread.</b>&mdash;Four potatoes mashed fine,
    four teaspoons of salt, two quarts of lukewarm milk, one-half
    cake Gillett's magic yeast dissolved in one-half cup of warm
    water, flour enough to make a pliable dough; mold with hands
    well greased with lard; place in pans, and when sufficiently
    light, it is ready for baking.</p>

    <p><b>French Bread.</b>&mdash;With a quarter of a peck of fine
    flour mix the yolks of three and whites of two eggs, beaten and
    strained, a little salt, half a pint of good yeast that is not
    bitter, and as much milk, made a little warm, as will work into
    a thin light dough. Stir it about, but don't knead it. Have
    ready three quart wooden dishes, divide the dough among them,
    set to rise, then turn them out into the oven, which must be
    quick. Rasp when done.</p>

    <p><b>Graham Bread.</b>&mdash;For one loaf, take two cups of
    white bread sponge, to which add two tablespoons of brown
    sugar, and graham flour to make a stiff batter; let it rise,
    after which add graham flour sufficient to knead, but not very
    stiff; then put it in the pan to rise and bake.</p>

    <p><b>Italian Bread.</b>&mdash;Make a stiff dough, with two
    pounds of fine flour, six of white powdered sugar, three or
    four eggs, a lemon-peel grated, and two ounces of fresh butter.
    If the dough is not firm enough, add more flour and sugar. Then
    turn it out, and work it well with the hand, cut it into round
    long biscuits, and glaze them with white of egg.</p>

    <p><b>Rice and Wheat Bread.</b>&mdash;Simmer a pound of rice in
    two quarts of water till soft; when it is of a proper warmth,
    mix it well with four pounds of flour, and yeast, and salt as
    for other bread; of yeast about four large spoonfuls; knead it
    well; then set to rise before the fire. Some of the flour
    should be reserved to make up the loaves. If the rice should
    require more water, it must be added, as some rice swells more
    than others.</p>

    <p><b>Sago Bread.</b>&mdash;Boil two lbs. of sago in three
    pints of water until reduced to a quart, then mix with it half
    a pint of yeast, and pour the mixture into fourteen lbs. of
    flour. Make into bread in the usual way.</p>

    <p><b>Steamed Bread.</b>&mdash;Two cups corn meal; 1 cup graham
    flour; 1/2 cup N. O. molasses; salt and teaspoonful of soda.
    Mix soft with sour milk, or make with sweet milk and Gillett's
    baking powder. Put in tight mold in kettle of water; steam
    three hours or more. This is as nice as Boston brown bread.</p>

    <p>Use this receipt with flour instead of graham; add a cup of
    beef suet, and it makes a nice pudding in the winter. Eat with
    syrup or cream.</p>

    <p><b>Biscuits.</b>&mdash;Mix a quart of sweet milk with half a
    cup of melted butter; stir in a pinch of salt, two teaspoonfuls
    of baking powder and flour enough for a stiff batter. Have the
    oven at a brisk heat. Drop the batter, a spoonful in a place,

    tablespoon of shortening, one-half teaspoon of salt, and three
    and a half heaping teaspoons of Gillett's baking powder; mix
    baking powder thoroughly through the flour, then add other
    ingredients. Do not knead, and bake quickly. To use cream
    tartar and soda, take the same proportions
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"
       id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span> without the baking powder,
       using instead two heaping teaspoons cream tartar and one of
       soda. If good they will bake in five minutes.</p>

    <p><b>Tea Biscuits.</b>&mdash;One cup of hot water, two of
    milk, three tablespoons of yeast; mix thoroughly; after it is
    risen, take two-thirds of a cup of butter and a little sugar

    flour, one-half a teacup of corn meal or wheat flour, a little
    salt, and two tablespoons of syrup. Wet these with cold or warm
    water to a thin batter, and add, lastly, four good-tablespoons
    of Gillett's baking powder.</p>

    <p><b>Spanish Buns.</b>&mdash;Five eggs well beaten; cut up in
    a cup of warm new milk half a pound of good butter, one pound
    of sifted flour, and a wineglassful of good yeast; stir these

    place; when risen, sift in half a pound of white sugar, and
    half a grated nutmeg; add one wineglass of wine and brandy,
    mixed, one wineglass of rose-water, and one cupful of currants,
    which have been cleaned thoroughly. Mix these well, pour it
    into pans, and set it to rise again for half an hour. Then bake
    one hour. Icing is a great improvement to their appearance.</p>

    <p><b>Bath Buns.</b>&mdash;- Take 1 lb. of flour, put it in a
    dish, and make a hole in the middle, and pour in a dessert
    spoonful of good yeast; pour upon the yeast half a cupful of
    warm milk, mix in one-third of the flour, and let it rise an
    hour. When it has risen, put in 6 ozs. of cold butter, 4 eggs,
    and a few caraway seeds; mix all together with the rest of the
    flour. Put it in a warm place to rise. Flatten it with the hand
    on a pasteboard. Sift 6 ozs. of loaf sugar, half the size of a
    pea; sprinkle the particles over the dough; roll together to

    little salt, one teaspoon of soda, one teaspoon of cream of
    tartar; bake in square tins.</p>

    <p><b>Mush.</b>&mdash;Indian or oatmeal mush is best made in
    the following manner: Put fresh water in a kettle over the fire
    to boil, and put in some salt; when the water boils, stir in
    handful by handful corn or oatmeal until thick enough for use.
    In order to have excellent mush, the meal should be allowed to
    cook well, and long as possible while thin, and before the
    final handful is added.</p>

    <p><b>Fried Mush.</b>&mdash;When desired to be fried for
    breakfast, turn into an earthen dish and set away to cool. Then
    cut in slices when you wish to fry; dip each piece in beaten
    eggs and fry on a hot griddle.</p>

    <p><b>English Pancakes.</b>&mdash;Make a batter of two teacups
    of flour, four eggs, and one quart of milk. Add, as a great
    improvement, one tablespoonful of brandy with a little nutmeg
    scraped in. Make the <ins class="correction"
         title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'sixe'.">
    size</ins> of frying pan. Sprinkle a little granulated sugar over the
    pancake, roll it up, and send to the table hot.</p>

    <p><b>Pop Overs.</b>&mdash;Three cups of milk and three cups
    flour, three eggs, a little salt, one tablespoon melted butter
    put in the last thing; two tablespoons to a puff.</p>

    <p><b>Rolls.</b>&mdash;To the quantity of light bread-dough
    that you would take for twelve persons, add the white of one
    egg well beaten, two tablespoons of white sugar, and two
    tablespoons of butter; work these thoroughly together; roll out
    about half an inch thick; cut the size desired, and spread one
    with melted butter and lay another upon the top of it. Bake
    delicately when they have risen.</p>

    <p><b>French Rolls.</b>&mdash;One quart flour, add two eggs,
    one half-pint milk, tablespoon of yeast, kneed it well; let
    rise till morning. Work in one ounce of butter, and mold in
    small rolls. Bake immediately.</p>

    eggs, two-thirds of a cup of butter, half a teaspoonful of
    salt, three teaspoonfuls of baking-powder; flour enough to make
    a nice batter. If you use sour milk leave out the
    baking-powder, and use two teaspoons soda. Splendid.</p>

    <p><b>Yeast.</b>&mdash;In reference to yeast, we advise the use
    of Magic Yeast Cakes; it keeps good a year, and works quicker
    and better than other yeasts.</p>

    <p><b>Suggestions in Making Cake.</b>&mdash;It is very
    desirable that the materials be of the finest quality. Sweet,
    fresh butter, eggs, and good flour are the first essentials.
    The process of putting together is also quite an important
    feature, and where other methods are not given in this work by
    contributors, it would be well for the young housekeeper to
    observe the following directions:</p>

    <p>Never allow the butter to oil, but soften it by putting in a
    moderately warm place before you commence other preparations
    for your cake; then put it into an earthen dish&mdash;tin, if
    not new, will discolor your cake as you stir it&mdash;and add
    your sugar; beat the butter and sugar to a cream, add the yolks
    of the eggs, then the milk, and lastly the beaten whites of the
    eggs and flour. Spices and liquors may be added after the yolks
    of the eggs are put in, and fruit should be put in with the
    flour.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"
       id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span>

    <p>The oven should be pretty hot for small cakes, and moderate
    for larger. To ascertain if a large cake is sufficiently baked,
    pierce it with a broom-straw through the center; if done, the
    straw will come out free from dough; if not done, dough will
    adhere to the straw. Take it out of the tin about fifteen
    minutes after it is taken from the oven (not sooner), and do
    not turn it over on the top to cool.</p>

    <p><b>Frosting.</b>&mdash;One pint granulated sugar, moisten
    thoroughly with water sufficient to dissolve it when heated;
    let it boil until it threads from the spoon, stirring often;
    while the sugar is boiling, beat the whites of two eggs till
    they are firm; then when thoroughly beaten, turn them into a
    deep dish, and when the sugar is boiled, turn it over the
    whites, beating all rapidly together until of the right
    consistency to spread over the cake. Flavor with lemon, if
    preferred. This is sufficient for two loaves.</p>

    <p><b>Frosting, for Cake.</b>&mdash;One cup frosting-sugar, two
    tablespoons of water boiled together; take it off the stove,
    and stir in the white of one egg beaten to a stiff froth; stir
    all together well, then frost your cake with it, and you will
    never want a nicer frosting than this.</p>

    <p><b>Chocolate Frosting.</b>&mdash;Whites of two eggs, one and
    one-half cups of fine sugar, six great spoons of grated
    chocolate, two teaspoons of vanilla; spread rather thickly
    between layers and on top of cake. Best when freshly made. It
    should be made like any frosting.</p>

    <p><b>Icing.</b>&mdash;The following rules should be observed
    where boiled icing is not used:</p>

    <p>Put the whites of your eggs in a shallow earthern dish, and
    allow at least a quarter of a pound or sixteen tablespoons of
    the finest white sugar for each egg. Take part of the sugar at
    first and sprinkle over the eggs; beat them for about half an
    hour, stirring in gradually the rest of the sugar; then add the
    flavor. If you use the juice of a lemon, allow more sugar.
    Tartaric and lemon-juice whitens icing. It may be shaded a
    pretty pink with strawberry-juice or cranberry syrup, or
    colored yellow by putting the juice and rind of a lemon in a
    thick muslin bag, and squeezing it hard into the egg and
    sugar.</p>

    <p>If cake is well dredged with flour after baking, and then
    carefully wiped before the icing is put on, it will not run,
    and can be spread more smoothly. Put frosting on to the cake in
    large spoonfuls, commencing over the center; then spread it
    over the cake, using a large knife, dipping it occasionally in
    cold water. Dry the frosting on the cake in a cool, dry
    place.</p>

    <p><b>Ice-Cream Icing, for White Cake.</b>&mdash;Two cups
    pulverized white sugar, boiled to a thick syrup; add three
    teaspoons vanilla; when cold, add the whites of two eggs well
    beaten, and flavored with two teaspoons of citric acid.</p>

    <p><b>Icing, for Cakes.</b>&mdash;Take ten whites of eggs
    whipped to a stiff froth, with twenty large spoonfuls of
    orange-flower water. This is to be laid smoothly on the cakes
    after they are baked. Then return them to the oven for fifteen
    minutes to harden the icing.</p>

    <p><b>Icing.</b>&mdash;One pound pulverized sugar, pour over
    one tablespoon cold water, beat whites of three eggs a little,
    not to a stiff froth; add to the sugar and water, put in a deep
    bowl, place in a vessel of boiling water, and heat. It will
    become thin and clear, afterward begin to thicken. When it
    becomes quite thick, remove from the fire and stir while it
    becomes cool till thick enough to spread with a knife. This
    will frost several ordinary-sized cakes.</p>

    <p><b>Almond Cake.</b>&mdash;Take ten eggs, beaten separately,
    the yolks from the whites; beat the yolks with half a pound of
    white sugar; blanch a quarter of a pound of almonds by pouring
    hot water on them, and remove the skins; pound them in a mortar
    smooth; add three drops of oil of bitter almonds; and
    rose-water to prevent the oiling of the almonds. Stir this also
    into the eggs. Half a pound of sifted flour stirred very slowly
    into the eggs; lastly, stir in the whites, which must have been
    whipped to a stiff froth. Pour this into the pans, and bake
    immediately three-quarters of an hour.</p>

    <p><b>Cocoanut Cake.</b>&mdash;Whip the whites of ten eggs,
    grate two nice cocoanuts, and add them; sift one pound of white
    sugar into half a pound of sifted flour; stir this well; add a
    little rose-water to flavor; pour into pans, and bake
    three-fourths of an hour.</p>

    <p><b>Cocoanut Drops.</b>&mdash;One pound each grated cocoanut
    and sugar; four well beaten eggs; four tablespoonfuls of flour,
    mix well, drop on pan, and bake.</p>

    <p><b>Cocoanut Jumbles.</b>&mdash;Take one cup butter, two cups
    sugar, three eggs well whipped, one grated cocoanut, stirred in
    lightly with the flour, which must be sufficient to stiffen to
    the required consistency. Bake one to know when enough flour is
    added.</p>

    <p><b>Coffee Cake.</b>&mdash;Take three eggs, two cups brown
    sugar, one cup strong coffee, quarter of cup of butter, three
    cups flour, one teaspoonful cream tartar, half teaspoonful each
    soda and ground cinnamon and cloves, half a nutmeg grated, one
    cup of raisins, stoned; beat butter and sugar to a cream, then
    add eggs beaten, coffee, flour sifted, and cream tartar, well
    mixed with it. Spices and raisins, then soda dissolved in
    sufficient warm water to absorb it. Thoroughly mix, and bake in
    round tins.</p>

    <p><b>Cookies.</b>&mdash;Two cups bright brown sugar, one cup
    butter, half cup sweet milk, two eggs, one teaspoonful soda,

    two cups butter, five cups flour, one wine-glass brandy, one
    nutmeg grated, half pound each raisins and currants, three
    teaspoonfuls Gillett's baking powder.</p>

    <p><b>Corn Starch Cake.</b>&mdash;Two cups pulverized sugar,
    one cup butter, cup corn starch, two cups sifted flour, seven
    eggs (whites beaten very light), one teaspoon soda, two
    teaspoons cream tartar (or two teaspoons caking powder instead
    of soda and cream tartar), flavor with lemon. In putting this
    together, beat butter and sugar to a light cream, dissolve corn
    starch in a cup of sweet milk, leaving enough of the milk to
    dissolve the soda if it is used, put cream of tartar or baking
    powder in the flour, beat the whites of the eggs separate when
    the butter and sugar are ready, put all the ingredients
    together first, leaving the eggs and flour to the last.</p>

    <p><b>Cream Cake.</b>&mdash;Half pint cream, one tablespoon
    butter rubbed into one tablespoon flour. Put the cream on the
    fire. When it boils stir in the butter and flour mixed, add
    half a tea cup sugar, two eggs very light, flavor with vanilla.
    Spread between cakes, and frost or sugar top of cake to please
    fancy.</p>

    <p><b>Cinnamon Cake.</b>&mdash;Take two cups of brown sugar,
    one cup of butter, three-quarters cup of milk, half cup of
    vinegar, four eggs, large tablespoon of cinnamon, four cups of
    flour, one teaspoon of soda, two teaspoons cream tartar, mix
    all but vinegar and soda, then add vinegar, then soda, bake in
    large tin or patty pans.</p>

    <p><b>Currant Cake.</b>&mdash;Take two pounds of flour, half a
    pound of butter rubbed in the flour, half a pound of moist
    sugar, a few caraway seeds, three or four tablespoonfuls of
    yeast, and a pint of milk made a little warm. Mix all together,
    and let it stand an hour or two at the fire to rise; then beat
    it up with three eggs and a half pound of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"
       id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span> Put it into a tin, and bake
       two hours in a moderate oven.</p>

    <p><b>Cup Cake.</b>&mdash;Cream half a cup of butter, and four
    cups of sugar by beating; stir in five well-beaten eggs;
    dissolve one teaspoonful of soda in a cup of good milk or
    cream, and six cups of sifted flour; stir all well together,
    and bake in tins.</p>

    <p><b>Delicate Cake.</b>&mdash;Mix two cups of sugar, four of
    flour, half cup butter, half cup sweet milk, the whites of
    seven eggs, two teaspoons cream tartar, one teaspoon soda, rub
    the cream tartar in the flour and other ingredients, and flavor
    to suit the taste.</p>

    <p><b>Delicious Swiss Cake.</b>&mdash;Beat the yolks of five
    eggs and one pound of sifted loaf sugar well together; then
    sift in one pound of best flour, and a large spoonful of anise
    seed; beat these together for twenty minutes; then whip to a
    stiff froth the five whites, and add them; beat all well; then
    roll out the paste an inch thick, and cut them with a molded
    cutter rather small; set them aside till the next morning to
    bake. Rub the tins on which they are baked with yellow wax; it
    is necessary to warm the tins to receive the wax; then let them
    become cool, wipe them, and lay on the cakes. Bake a light
    brown.</p>

    <p><b>Doughnuts.</b>&mdash;One and a half cup of sugar; half
    cup sour milk, two teaspoons soda, little nutmeg, four eggs,
    flour enough to roll out.</p>

    <p><b>Drop Cake.</b>&mdash;- To one pint cream, three eggs, one
    pinch of salt, thicken with rye till a spoon will stand upright
    in it, then drop on a well buttered iron pan which must be hot
    in the oven.</p>

    <p><b>Drop Cookies.</b>&mdash;Whites of two eggs, one large cup
    of milk, one cup of sugar, one-half cup of butter, two
    teaspoonfuls baking-powder, flavor with vanilla, rose, or

    sugar, two eggs, half pint melted butter, two teaspoons even
    full of soda, dissolve in milk flour enough to roll out into
    shape, and fry in hot lard.</p>

    <p><b>Fried Cakes.</b>&mdash;Three eggs, one cup of sugar, one
    pint of new milk, salt, nutmeg, and flour enough to permit the
    spoon to stand upright in the mixture; add two teaspoonfuls of
    Gillett's baking powder and beat until very light. Drop by the
    dessert-spoonful into boiling lard. These will not absorb a bit
    of fat, and are the least pernicious of the doughnut
    family.</p>

    <p><b>Fruit Cake.</b>&mdash;Take four pounds of brown sugar,
    four pounds of good butter, beaten to cream; put four pounds of
    sifted flour into a pan; whip thirty-two eggs to a fine froth,
    and add to the creamed butter and sugar; then take six pounds
    of cleaned currants, four pounds of stoned raisins, two pounds
    of cut citron, one pound of blanched almonds, crushed, but not
    pounded, to a paste&mdash;a large cup of molasses, two large
    spoonfuls of ground ginger, half an ounce of pounded mace, half
    an ounce of grated nutmeg, half an ounce of pounded and sifted
    cloves, and one of cinnamon. Mix these well together, then add
    four large wineglasses of good French brandy, and lastly, stir
    in the flour; beat this well, put it all into a stone jar,
    cover very closely, for twelve hours; then make into six
    loaves, and bake in iron pans. These cakes will keep a year, if
    attention is paid to their being put in a tin case, and covered
    lightly in an airy place. They improve by keeping.</p>

    <p><b>Ginger Drop Cake.</b>&mdash;Cup each sugar, molasses,
    lard and boiling water, one teaspoon soda, half teaspoon cream
    tartar, stir in flour until it is as thick as cake, add sugar
    and salt.</p>

    <p><b>Ginger Snaps.</b>&mdash;Take one cup each of sugar,
    molasses, butter, half cup sour milk, two teaspoons cream
    tartar, one teaspoon soda, flour enough to roll out, cut into
    size desired and bake.</p>

    <p><b>Ginger Snaps.</b>&mdash;Two cups of New Orleans molasses,
    one cup of sugar, one of butter, one teaspoonful of soda, one
    of cloves, one of black pepper, and two tablespoons of ginger.
    These will keep good a month if you wish to keep them.</p>

    <p><b>Graham Cakes.</b>&mdash;Half a cup of butter, one-half
    cup sugar, one egg, one teacup sour milk, one-half teaspoon
    soda. Make a stiff batter by adding graham flour.</p>

    sweet cream, the white of one egg beaten to froth, half a
    spoonful of salt, dessert spoonful baking powder, stir in
    stiffened graham flour until quite thick, bake in muffin-rings
    or gem-tins, until well browned on top.</p>

    <p><b>Indian Breakfast Patties.</b>&mdash;To one pint of Indian

    crossways; now run the knife through it, and lay it open for a
    few moments, just to let the steam escape (the steam ruins the
    color of the berries); then set the bottom crust on the
    platter; cover thickly with the berries, an inch and a half
    deep; lay the top crust on the fruit; dust thickly with
    powdered sugar, and if any berry juice is left in the bowl,
    pour it round the cake, not over it, and you will have a
    delicious short-cake.</p>

    <p><b>Snow Cream.</b>&mdash;To a quart of cream add the whites
    of three eggs, cut to a stiff froth, add four spoonfuls of
    sweet wine, sugar to taste, flavor with essence of lemon. Whip
    all to a froth, and as soon as it forms take it off and serve
    in glasses.</p>

    <p><b>Stewed Figs.</b>&mdash;Take four ounces of fine sugar,
    the thin rind of a large lemon, and a pint of cold water, when
    the sugar is dissolved, add one pound turkey figs, and place
    the stew-pan over a moderate fire where they may heat and swell
    slowly, and stew gently for two hours, when they are quite
    tender, add the juice of one lemon, arrange them in a glass
    dish and serve cold.</p>

    <p><b>Spanish Cream.</b>&mdash;Dissolve in 1/2 pint of
    rose-water, 1 oz. of isinglass cut small; run it through a hair
    sieve; add the yolks of three or four eggs, beaten and mixed
    with half a pint of cream, and two sorrel leaves. Pour it into
    a deep dish, sweeten with loaf sugar powdered. Stir it till
    cold, and put it into molds. Lay rings round in different
    colored sweetmeats. Add, if you like, a little sherry, and a
    lump or two of sugar, rubbed well upon the rind of a lemon to
    extract the flavor.</p>

    <p><b>Whipped Cream.</b>&mdash;To one quart of good cream, put
    a few drops of bergamot water, a little orange-flower water,
    and 1/2 lb. of sugar. When it is dissolved, whip the cream to a
    froth, and take it up with a skimmer; drain on a sieve, and if
    for icing, let it settle half an hour before you put it into
    cups or glasses. Use that which drops into the dish under the
    sieve, to make it froth the better, adding two whites of eggs.
    Colored powdered sugar may, if you like, be sprinkled on the
    top of each.</p>

    <p><b>Asparagus Omelet.</b>&mdash;Boil a dozen of the largest
    and finest asparagus heads you can pick; cut off all the green
    portion, and chop it in thin slices; season with a small
    teaspoonful of salt, and about one-fourth of that quantity of
    soluble cayenne. Then beat up six eggs in a sufficient quantity
    of new milk to make a stiffish batter. Melt in the frying-pan a
    quarter of a pound of good, clean dripping, and just before you
    pour on the batter place a small piece of butter in the center
    of the pan. When the dripping is quite hot, pour on half your
    batter, and as it begins to set, place on it the asparagus
    tops, and cover over with the remainder. This omelet is
    generally served on a round of buttered toast, with the crusts
    removed. The batter is richer if made of cream.</p>

    <p><b>Buttered Eggs.</b>&mdash;Beat four or five eggs, yolks
    and whites together, put a quarter of a pound of butter in a
    basin, and then put that in boiling water, stir it till
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"
       id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span> then pour the butter and
       the eggs into a sauce-pan; keep a basin in your hand, just
       hold the sauce-pan in the other over a slow part of the
       fire, shaking it one way, as it begins to warm; pour it into
       a basin, and back, then hold it again over the fire,
       stirring it constantly in the saucepan, and pouring it into
       the basin, more perfectly to mix the egg and butter until
       they shall be hot without boiling.</p>

    <p>Serve on toasted bread; or in a basin, to eat with salt
    fish, or red herrings.</p>

    <p><b>Corn-Oysters.</b>&mdash;Take a half dozen ears of sweet
    corn (those which are not too old); with a sharp knife split
    each row of the corn in the center of the kernel lengthwise;
    scrape out all the pulp; add one egg, well beaten, a little
    salt, one tablespoonful of sweet milk; flour enough to make a
    pretty stiff batter. Drop in hot lard, and fry a delicate
    brown. If the corn is quite young, omit the milk, using as
    little flour as possible.</p>

    <p><b>Cheese Omelet.</b>&mdash;Mix to a smooth batter three
    tablespoonfuls of fine flour, with half a pint of milk. Beat up
    well the yolks and whites of four eggs, a little salt, and a
    quarter of a pound of grated old English cheese. Add these to
    the flour and milk, and whisk all the ingredients together for
    half an hour. Put three ounces of butter into a frying-pan, and
    when it is boiling pour in the above mixture, fry it for a few
    minutes, and then turn it carefully; when it is sufficiently
    cooked on the other side, turn it on to a hot dish and
    serve.</p>

    <p><b>Irish Stew.</b>&mdash;Take a loin of mutton, cut it into
    chops, season it with a very little pepper and salt, put it
    into a saucepan, just cover it with water, and let it cook half
    an hour. Boil two dozen of potatoes, peel and mash them, and
    stir in a cup of cream while they are hot; then line a deep
    dish with the potatoes, and lay in the cooked mutton chops, and
    cover them over with the rest of the potatoes; then set it in
    the oven to bake. Make some gravy of the broth in which the
    chops were cooked. This is a very nice dish.</p>

    <p><b>Irish Stew.</b>&mdash;Cut off the fat of part of a loin
    of mutton, and cut it into chops. Pare, wash, and slice very
    thin some potatoes, two onions, and two small carrots; season
    with pepper and salt. Cover with water in a stew-pan, and stew
    gently till the meat is tender, and the potatoes are dissolved
    in the gravy. It may be made of beef-steaks, or mutton and beef
    mixed.</p>

    <p><b>Macaroni, Dressed Sweet.</b>&mdash;Boil 2 ozs. in a pint
    of milk, with a bit of lemon peel, and a good bit of cinnamon,
    till the pipes are swelled to their utmost size without
    breaking. Lay them on a custard-dish, and pour a custard over
    them hot. Serve cold.</p>

    <p><b>Macaroni, as Usually Served.</b>&mdash;Boil it in milk,
    or a weak veal broth, flavored with salt. When tender, put it
    into a dish without the liquor, with bits of butter and grated
    cheese, and over the top grate more, and put a little more
    butter. Put the dish into a Dutch oven, a quarter of an hour,
    and do not let the top become hard.</p>

    <p><b>Omelet.</b>&mdash;Six eggs beaten separately, beaten
    hard, two teaspoons of corn starch, two tablespoons milk,
    whites of eggs, put in slow at last. Fry in butter.</p>

    <p><b>Rumbled Eggs.</b>&mdash;This is very convenient for
    invalids, or a light dish for supper. Beat up three eggs with
    two ounces of fresh butter, or well-washed salt butter; add a
    teaspoonful of cream or new milk. Put all in a saucepan and
    keep stirring it over the fire for nearly five minutes, until
    it rises up like scuffle, when it should be immediately dished
    on buttered toast.</p>

    <p><b>Poached Eggs.</b>&mdash;Break an egg into a cup, and put
    it gently into boiling water; and when the white looks quite
    set, which will be in about three or four minutes, take it up
    with an egg slice, and lay it on toast and butter, or spinach.
    Serve them hot; if fresh laid, they will poach well, without
    breaking.</p>

    <p><b>Savory Potato-Cakes.</b>&mdash;Quarter of a pound of
    grated ham, one pound of mashed potatoes, and a little suet,
    mixed with the yolks of two eggs, pepper, salt and nutmeg. Roll
    it into little balls, or cakes, and fry it a light brown. Sweet
    herbs may be used in place of ham. Plain potato cakes are made
    with potatoes and eggs only.</p>

    <p><b>Tomato Toast.</b>&mdash;Remove the stem and all the seeds
    from the tomatoes; they must be ripe, mind, not <i>over
    ripe</i>; stew them to a pulp, season with butter, pepper and
    salt; toast some bread (not new bread), butter it, and then
    spread the tomato on each side, and send it up to table, two
    slices on each dish, the slices cut in two; and the person who
    helps it must serve with two half-slices, not attempt to lift
    the top slice, otherwise the appearance of the under slice will
    be destroyed.</p>

    <h3>HOW TO COOK FISH<br />
    OF DIFFERENT KINDS</h3>

    <p><b>How to Choose Anchovies.</b>&mdash;They are preserved in
    barrels, with bay-salt; no other fish has the fine flavor of
    the anchovy. The best look red and mellow, and the bones moist
    and oily; the flesh should be high flavored, the liquor
    reddish, and have a fine smell.</p>

    <p><b>Baked Black Bass.</b>&mdash;Eight good-sized onions
    chopped fine; half that quantity of bread crumbs; butter size
    of hen's egg; plenty of pepper and salt; mix thoroughly with
    anchovy sauce until quite red. Stuff your fish with this
    compound and pour the rest over it, previously sprinkling it
    with a little red pepper. Shad, pickerel and trout are good the
    same way. Tomatoes can be used instead of anchovies, and are
    more economical. If using them, take pork in place of butter,
    and chop fine.</p>

    <p><b>Boiled White Fish.</b>&mdash;Lay the fish open; put it in
    a dripping pan with the back down; nearly cover with water; to
    one fish put two tablespoons salt, cover tightly and simmer
    (not boil) one-half hour; dress with gravy, butter and pepper;
    garnish with sliced eggs.</p>

    <p>For sauce use a piece of butter the size of an egg, one
    tablespoon of flour, one half pint boiling water; boil a few
    minutes, and add three hard boiled eggs, sliced.</p>

    <p><b>Fresh Broiled White Fish.</b>&mdash;Wash and drain the
    fish: sprinkle with pepper and lay with the inside down upon
    the gridiron, and broil over fresh bright coals. When a nice
    brown, turn for a moment on the other side, then take up and
    spread with butter. This is a very nice way of broiling all
    kinds of fish, fresh or salted. A little smoke under the fish
    adds to its flavor. This may be made by putting two or three
    cobs under the gridiron.</p>

    <p><b>To Boil Codfish.</b>&mdash;If boiled fresh, it is watery;
    but it is excellent if salted, and hung for a day, to give it
    firmness. Wash and clean the fish well, and rub salt inside of
    it; tie it up, and put it on the fire in cold water; throw a
    handful of salt into the fish-kettle. Boil a small fish 15
    minutes; a large one 30 minutes. Serve it without the smallest
    speck and scum; drain. Garnish it with lemon, horseradish, the
    milt, roe, and liver. Oyster or shrimp sauce may be used.</p>

    <p><b>Chowder.</b>&mdash;Five pounds of codfish cut in squares;
    fry plenty of salt pork cut in thin slices; put a layer of pork
    in your kettle, then one of fish; one of potatoes in thick
    slices, and one of onions in slices; plenty of pepper and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"
       id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span> repeat as long as your
       materials last, and finish with a layer of Boston crackers
       or crusts of bread. Water sufficient to cook with, or milk
       if you prefer. Cook one-half hour and turn over on your
       platter, disturbing as little as possible. Clams and eels
       the same way.</p>

    <p><b>Clam Fritters.</b>&mdash;Twelve clams chopped or not, one
    pint milk, three eggs, add liquor from clams; salt and pepper,
    and flour enough for thin batter. Fry in hot lard.</p>

    <p><b>Clam Stew.</b>&mdash;Lay the clams on a gridiron over hot
    coals, taking them out of the shell as soon as open, saving the
    juice; add a little hot water, pepper, a very little salt and
    butter rolled in flour sufficient for seasoning; cook for five
    minutes and pour over toast.</p>

    <p><b>Eels, to Stew.</b>&mdash;Of the above fish, that of the
    "silver" kind is preferable to its congener, and, therefore,
    ought to be procured for all cuisine purposes. Take from three
    to four pounds of these eels, and let the same be thoroughly
    cleansed, inside and out, rescinding the heads and tails from
    the bodies. Cut them into pieces three inches in length each,
    and lay them down in a stew pan, covering them with a
    sufficiency of sweet mutton gravy to keep them seething over a
    slow fire, when introduced into the pan, for twenty minutes.
    Add to the liquor, before you place your eels into it, a
    quarter of an ounce of whole black pepper, quarter of an ounce
    of allspice, with one or two pieces of white ginger. Thicken
    with a light admixture of flour and butter, stirring it
    carefully round, adding thereto, at the same time, one gill of
    good port wine, and half a gill of sweet ketchup. Lemon-peel
    and salt may be added in accordance with your taste.</p>

    <p><b>How to Keep Fish Sound.</b>&mdash;To prevent meat, fish,
    etc., going bad, put a few pieces of charcoal into the
    sauce-pan wherein the fish or flesh is to be boiled.</p>

    <p><b>How to Render Boiled Fish Firm.</b>&mdash;Add a little
    saltpetre to the salt in the water in which the fish is to be
    boiled; a quarter of an ounce to one gallon.</p>

    <p><b>Fish Balls.</b>&mdash;Bone, cooked fresh, or salt fish,
    add double the quantity of mashed potatoes, one beaten egg, a
    little butter, pepper and salt to taste. Make in cakes or
    balls; dredge with flour and fry in hot lard.</p>

    <p><b>Potted Fish.</b>&mdash;Take out the back-bone of the
    fish; for one weighing two pounds take a tablespoon of allspice
    and cloves mixed; these spices should be put into bags of not
    too thick muslin; put sufficient salt directly upon each fish;
    then roll in cloth, over which sprinkle a little cayenne
    pepper; put alternate layers of fish, spice and sago in an
    earthen jar; cover with the best cider vinegar; cover the jar
    closely with a plate and over this put a covering of dough,
    rolled out to twice the thickness of pie crust. Make the edges
    of paste, to adhere closely to the sides of the jar, so as to
    make it air-tight. Put the jar into a pot of cold water and let
    it boil from three to five hours, according to quantity. Ready
    when cold.</p>

    <p><b>How to Broil or Roast Fresh Herrings.</b>&mdash;Scale,
    gut and wash; cut off the heads; steep them in salt and vinegar
    ten minutes; dust them with flour, and broil them over or
    before the fire, or in the oven. Serve with melted butter and
    parsley.</p>

    <p>Herrings are nice <i>jarred</i>, and done in the oven, with
    pepper, cloves, salt, a little vinegar, a few bay-leaves, and a
    little butter.</p>

    <p><b>How to Fry Fresh Herrings.</b>&mdash;Slice small onions,
    and lay in the pan with the herrings; add a little butter, and
    fry them. Perhaps it is better to fry the onions separately
    with a little parsley, and butter or drip.</p>

    <p><b>How to Pot Herrings.</b>&mdash;Clean, cut off the heads,
    and lay them close in an earthen pot. Strew a little salt
    between every layer; put in cloves, mace, whole pepper, cayenne
    and nutmeg; fill up the jar with vinegar, water, and a quarter
    of a pint of sherry, cover, tie down; bake in an oven, and when
    cold pot it for use. A few anchovies and bay leaves intermixed
    will improve the flavor much.</p>

    <p><b>Buttered Lobsters.</b>&mdash;Pick the meat out, cut it,
    and warm with a little brown gravy, nutmeg, salt, pepper and
    butter, with a little flour. If done white, a little white
    gravy and cream.</p>

    <p><b>Curry Of Lobster.</b>&mdash;Take them from the shells,
    and lay into a pan, with a small piece of mace, three or four
    spoonfuls of veal gravy, and four of cream; rub smooth one or
    two teaspoonfuls of curry-powder, a teaspoonful of flour, and
    an ounce of butter, simmer an hour; squeeze half a lemon in,
    and add salt.</p>

    <p><b>Lobster Chowder.</b>&mdash;Four or five pounds of
    lobster, chopped fine; take the green part and add to it four
    pounded crackers; stir this into one quart of boiling milk;
    then add the lobster, a piece of butter one-half the size of an
    egg, a little pepper and salt, and bring it to a boil.</p>

    <p><b>How to Boil Mackerel.</b>&mdash;Rub them with vinegar;
    when the water boils, put them in with a little salt, and boil
    gently 15 minutes. Serve with fennel and parsley chopped, boil,
    and put into melted butter, and gooseberry sauce.</p>

    <p><b>Salt Mackerel.</b>&mdash;Soak the fish for a few hours in
    lukewarm water, changing the water several times; then put into
    cold water loosely tied in cloths, and let the fish come to a
    boil, turning off the water once, and pouring over the fish hot
    water from the tea-kettle; let this just come to a boil, then
    take them out and drain them, lay them on a platter, butter and
    pepper them, and place them for a few moments in the oven.
    Serve with sliced lemons, or with any fish sauce.</p>

    <p><b>How to Fry Oysters.</b>&mdash;Use the largest and best
    oysters; lay them in rows upon a clean cloth and press another
    upon them, to absorb the moisture; have ready several beaten
    eggs; and in another dish some finely crushed crackers: in the
    frying pan heat enough butter to entirely cover the oysters;
    dip the oysters first into the eggs, then into the crackers,
    rolling it or them over, that they may become well incrusted;
    drop into the frying pan and fry quickly to a light brown.
    Serve dry and let the dish be warm. A chafing dish is best.</p>

    <p><b>Oyster Patties.</b>&mdash;Make some rich puff paste and
    bake it in very small tin patty pans; when cool, turn them out
    upon a large dish; stew some large fresh oysters with a few
    cloves, and a little mace and nutmeg; then add the yolk of one
    egg, boiled hard and grated; add a little butter, and as much
    of the oyster liquor as will cover them. When they have stewed
    a little while, take them off the pan and set them to cool.
    When quite cold, lay two or three oysters in each shell of puff
    paste.</p>

    <p><b>Oysters, Stewed.</b>&mdash;In all cases, unless shell
    oysters, wash and drain; mix half a cup of butter and a
    tablespoon of corn starch; put with the oysters in a porcelain
    kettle; stir until they boil; add two cups of cream or milk;
    salt to taste; do not use the liquor of the oysters in either
    stewing or escaloping.</p>

    <p><b>Oysters Stewed.</b>&mdash;Scald the oysters in their own
    liquor, then take them out, beard them, and strain the liquor
    carefully from the grit. Put into a stewpan an ounce of butter,
    with sufficient flour dredged in to dry it up; add the oyster
    liquor, and a blade of pounded mace, a little cayenne, and a
    very little salt to taste; stir it well over a brisk fire with
    a wooden spoon, and when it comes to the boil, throw in your
    oysters, say a dozen and a half or a score, and a good
    tablespoonful of cream, or more, if you have it at hand. Shake
    the pan over the fire, and let it simmer for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"
       id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span> one or two minutes, but not
       any longer, and do not let it boil, or the fish will harden.
       Serve in a hot dish, garnished with sippets of toasted
       bread. Some persons think that the flavor is improved by
       boiling a small piece of lemon-peel with the oyster liquor,
       taking it out, however, before the cream is added.</p>

    <p><b>Oysters Scolloped.</b>&mdash;Beard and trim your oysters,
    and strain the liquor. Melt in a stewpan, with a dredging of
    flour sufficient to dry it up, an ounce of butter, and two
    tablespoonfuls of white stock, and the same of cream; the
    strained liquor and pepper, and salt to taste. Put in the
    oysters and gradually heat them through, but be sure not to let
    them boil. Have your scallop-shells buttered, lay in the
    oysters, and as much liquid as they will hold; cover them well
    over with bread-crumbs, over which spread, or drop, some tiny
    bits of butter. Brown them in the oven, or before the fire, and
    serve while very hot.</p>

    <p><b>Oysters, To Pickle.</b>&mdash;Take two hundred of the
    plumpest, nicest oysters to be had, open them, saving the
    liquor, remove the beards, put them, with the liquor, into a
    stewpan, and let them simmer for twenty minutes over a very
    gentle fire, taking care to skim them well. Take the stewpan
    off the fire, take out the oysters, and strain the liquor
    through a fine cloth, returning the oysters to the stewpan. Add
    to a pint of the hot liquor half an ounce of mace, and half an
    ounce of cloves; give it a boil, and put it in with the
    oysters, stirring the spice well in amongst them. Then put in
    about a spoonful of salt, three-quarters of a pint of
    white-wine vinegar, and one ounce of whole pepper, and let the
    oysters stand until they are quite cold. They will be ready for
    use in about twelve or twenty-four hours; if to be kept longer
    they should be put in wide-mouthed bottles, or stone jars, and
    well drawn down with bladder. It is very important that they
    should be quite cold before they are put into the bottles, or
    jars.</p>

    <p><b>Salmon, To Boil.</b>&mdash;Clean it carefully, boil it
    gently with salt and a little horse radish; take it out of the
    water as soon as done. Let the water be warm if the fish be
    split. If underdone it is very unwholesome. Serve with shrimp,
    lobster, or anchovy sauce, and fennel and butter.</p>

    <p><b>Salmon, To Marinate.</b>&mdash;Cut the salmon in slices;
    take off the skin and take out the middle bone; cut each slice
    asunder; put into a saucepan and season with salt, pepper, 6
    cloves, a sliced onion, some whole chives, a little sweet
    basil, parsley, and a bay leaf; then squeeze in the juice of
    three lemons, or use vinegar. Let the salmon lie in the
    marinate for two hours; take it out; dry with a cloth; dredge
    with flour, and fry brown in clarified butter; then lay a clean
    napkin in a dish; lay the slices upon it; garnish with fried
    parsley.</p>

    <p><b>Salt Cod, To Dress.</b>&mdash;Soak the cod all night in 2
    parts water, and one part vinegar. Boil; and break into flakes
    on the dish; pour over it boiled parsnips, beaten in a mortar,
    and then boil up with cream, and a large piece of butter rolled
    in a bit of flour. It may be served with egg-sauce instead of
    parsnip, or boiled and served without flaking with the usual
    sauce.</p>

    <p>All <i>Salt Fish</i> may be done in a similar way. Pour
    egg-sauce over it, or parsnips, boiled and beaten fine with
    butter and cream.</p>

    <p><b>How to Boil Sturgeon</b>&mdash;Water, 2 quarts; vinegar,
    1 pint; a stick of horseradish; a little lemon-peel, salt,
    pepper, a bay leaf. In this boil the fish; when the fish is
    ready to leave the bones, take it up; melt 1/2 lb. of butter;
    add an anchovy, some mace, a few shrimps, good mushroom
    ketchup, and lemon juice; when it boils, put in the dish; serve
    with the sauce; garnish with fried oysters, horseradish and
    lemon.</p>

    <p><b>How to Broil Sturgeon.</b>&mdash;Cut slices, rub beaten
    eggs over them, and sprinkle them with crumbs of bread,
    parsley, pepper and salt; wrap them in white paper, and broil
    gently. Use for sauce, butter, anchovy and soy.</p>

    <p><b>How to Dress Fresh Sturgeon.</b>&mdash;Cut slices, rub
    egg over them, then sprinkle with crumbs of bread, parsley,
    pepper, salt; fold them in paper, and broil gently. Sauce;
    butter, anchovy and soy.</p>

    <p><b>How to Roast Sturgeon.</b>&mdash;Put a piece of butter,
    rolled in flour, into a stewpan with four cloves, a bunch of
    sweet herbs, two onions, some pepper and salt, half a pint of
    water and a glass of vinegar. Set it over the fire till hot;
    then let it become lukewarm, and steep the fish in it an hour
    or two. Butter a paper well, tie it round, and roast it without
    letting the spit run through. Serve with sorrel and anchovy
    sauce.</p>

    <p><b>Trout, a-la-Genevoise</b>&mdash;Clean the fish well; put
    it into the stewpan, adding half champagne and half sherry
    wine. Season it with pepper, salt, an onion, a few cloves stuck
    in it, and a small bunch of parsley and thyme; put in it a
    crust of French bread; set it on a quick fire. When done take
    the bread out, bruise it and thicken the sauce: add flour and a
    little butter, and boil it up. Lay the fish on the dish, and
    pour the sauce over it. Serve it with sliced lemon and fried
    bread.</p>

    <p><b>How to Broil Trout</b>&mdash;Wash, dry, tie it, to cause
    it to keep its shape; melt butter, add salt, and cover the
    trout with it. Broil it gradually in a Dutch oven, or in a
    common oven. Cut an anchovy small, and chop some capers. Melt
    some butter with a little flour, pepper, salt, nutmeg, and half
    a spoonful of vinegar. Pour it over the trout and serve it
    hot.</p>

    <h3>HOW TO CHOOSE<br />
    AND COOK GAME</h3>

    <p><b>How to Choose Ducks</b>&mdash;A young duck should have
    supple feet, breast and belly hard and thick. A tame duck has
    dusky yellow feet. They should be picked dry, and ducklings
    scalded.</p>

    <p><b>How to Roast Ducks.</b>&mdash;Carefully pick, and clean
    the inside. Boil two or three onions in two waters; chop them
    very small. Mix the onions with about half the quantity of sage
    leaves, bread crumbs finely powdered, a spoonful of salt, and a
    little cayenne paper; beat up the yolk of an egg, and rub the
    stuffing well together. With a brisk fire roast about 35
    minutes. Serve with gravy sauce.</p>

    <p><b>How to Stew Ducks.</b>&mdash;Lard two young ducks down
    each side the breast; dust with flour; brown before the fire;
    put into a stewpan with a quart of water, a pint of port wine,
    a spoonful of walnut ketchup, the same of browning, one
    anchovy, a clove of garlick, sweet herbs and cayenne pepper.
    Stew till they are tender, about half an hour; skim and strain,
    and pour over the duck.</p>

    <p><b>How to Hash Partridge.</b>&mdash;Cut up the partridges as
    for eating; slice an onion into rings; roll a little butter in
    flour; put them into the tossing pan, and shake it over the
    fire till it boils; put in the partridge with a little port
    wine and vinegar; and when it is thoroughly hot, lay it on the
    dish with sippets round it; strain the sauce over the
    partridge, and lay on the onion in rings.</p>

    <p><b>How to Pot Partridge.</b>&mdash;Clean them nicely; and
    season with mace, allspice, white pepper and salt, in fine
    powder. Rub every part well; then lay the breast downward in a
    pan, and pack the birds as closely as you possibly can. Put a
    good deal of butter on them; then cover
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"

         title="Transcribers's Note: The original text reads 'he'.">the</ins>
         pan with a coarse flour paste and a paper over, tie it
         close, and bake. When cold, put the birds into pots, and
         cover with butter.</p>

    <p><b>How to Roast Partridge.</b>&mdash;Roast them like a
    turkey, and when a little under roasted, dredge them with
    flour, and baste them with butter; let them go to table with a
    fine froth; put gravy sauce in the dish, and bread sauce on the
    table.</p>

    <p><b>How to Stew Partridge.</b>&mdash;Truss as for roasting;
    stuff the craws, and lard them down each side of the breast;
    roll a lump of butter in pepper, salt and beaten mace, and put
    them inside; sew up the vents; dredge them well and fry a light
    brown; put them into a stewpan with a quart of good gravy, a
    spoonful of sherry wine, the same of mushroom ketchup, a
    teaspoonful of lemon pickle, and a little mushroom powder, one
    anchovy, half a lemon, a sprig of sweet marjoram; cover the pan
    close, and stew half an hour; take out, and thicken the gravy;
    boil a little, and pour it over the partridge, and lay round
    them artichoke buttons, boiled, and cut in quarters, and the
    yolks of four hard eggs, if agreeable.</p>

    <p><b>How to Roast Pheasant.</b>&mdash;Roast them as turkey;
    and serve with a fine gravy (into which put a very small bit of
    garlic) and bread sauce. When cold, they may be made into
    excellent patties, but their flavor should not be overpowered
    by lemon.</p>

    <p><b>How to Roast Plovers.</b>&mdash;Roast the <i>green</i>
    ones in the same way as woodcocks and quails, without drawing,
    and serve on a toast. <i>Grey</i> plovers may be either roasted
    or stewed with gravy, herbs and spice.</p>

    <p><b>How to Fricassee Quails.</b>&mdash;Having tossed them up
    in a sauce-pan with a little melted butter and mushrooms, put

    savory herbs; add good gravy, and a glass of sherry; simmer
    over a slow fire; when almost done, thicken the ragout with a
    good cullis, (i. e. a good broth, strained, gelatined, etc.) or
    with two or three eggs, well beaten up in a little gravy.</p>

    <p><b>How to Roast Quails.</b>&mdash;Roast them without drawing
    and serve on toast. Butter only should be eaten with them, as
    gravy takes off the fine flavor. The thigh and the back are the
    most esteemed.</p>

    <p><b>How to Roast Rabbits.</b>&mdash;Baste them with butter,
    and dredge them with flour; half an hour will do them at a
    brisk fire; and if small, twenty minutes. Take the livers with
    a bunch of parsley, boil them, and chop them very fine
    together; melt some butter, and put half the liver and parsley
    into the butter; pour it into the dish, and garnish the dish
    with the other half; roast them to a fine light brown.</p>

    <p><b>How to Make Rabbit Taste Like a Hare.</b>&mdash;Choose
    one that is young, but full grown; hang it in the skin three or
    four days; then skin it, and lay it, without washing, in a
    seasoning of black pepper and allspice in a very fine powder, a
    glass of port wine, and the same quantity of vinegar. Baste it
    occasionally for 40 hours, then stuff it and roast it as a
    hare, and with the same sauce. Do not wash off the liquor that
    it was soaked in.</p>

    <p><b>How to Roast Snipes</b>&mdash;Do not draw them. Split
    them; flour them, and baste with butter. Toast a slice of bread
    brown; place it in the dish under the birds for the trail to
    drop on. When they are done enough, take up, and lay them on
    the toast; put good gravy in the dish. Serve with butter, and
    garnish with orange or lemon.</p>

    <p><b>Snipe Pie</b>&mdash;Bone 4 snipes, and truss them. Put in
    their inside finely chopped bacon, or other forcemeat; put them
    in the dish with the breast downwards, and put forcemeat balls
    around them. Add gravy made of butter, and chopped veal and
    ham, parsley, pepper and shalots. Cover with nice puff paste;
    close it well to keep in the gravy. When nearly done, pour in
    more gravy, and a little sherry wine. Bake two or three
    hours.</p>

    <p><b>How to Fry Venison</b>&mdash;Cut the meat into slices,
    and make a gravy of the bones; fry it of a light brown, and
    keep it hot before the fire; put butter rolled in flour into
    the pan, and stir it till thick and brown; add 1/2 lb. of loaf
    sugar powdered, with the gravy made from the bones, and some
    port wine. Let it be as thick as cream; squeeze in a lemon;
    warm the venison in it; put it in the dish, and pour the sauce
    over it.</p>

    <h3>HOW TO MAKE ICE CREAMS<br />
    <br />
    WATER-ICE AND JELLIES</h3>

    <p><b>To Mold Ices</b>&mdash;Fill your mold as quickly as
    possible with the frozen cream, wrap it up in paper, and bury
    it in ice and salt, and let it remain for an hour or more to
    harden. For dishing, have the dish ready, dip the mold in hot
    water for an instant, wipe it, take off the top and bottom
    covers, and turn it into the dish. This must be done
    expeditiously. In molding ices, it is advisable not to have the
    cream too stifly frozen before putting it into the mold.</p>

    <p><b>Ice Cream</b>&mdash;Take two quarts milk, one pint cream,
    three eggs beaten very light, and two teaspoons of arrowroot;
    boil in one-half pint milk, strain eggs, arrow-root, and flavor

    strawberries, carefully picked, and, with a wooden spoon, rub
    them through a hair sieve, and about half a pound of powdered
    sugar, and the juice of one lemon; color with a few drops of
    prepared cochineal; cream, one pint; then freeze. This will
    make a reputed quart. When fresh strawberries are not in season
    take strawberry jam, the juice of two lemons, cream, to one
    quart. Color, strain, and freeze. Milk may be substituted for
    cream, and makes good ices. If too much sugar is used, the ices
    will prove watery, or, perhaps not freeze at all.</p>

    <p><b>Vanilla Ice Cream</b>&mdash;Pound one stick of vanilla,
    or sufficient to flavor it to palate, in a mortar, with half a
    pound of sugar; strain through a sieve upon the yolks of two
    eggs, put it into a stewpan, with half a pint of milk; simmer
    over a slow fire, stirring all the time, the same as custard;
    when cool add one pint of cream and the juice of one lemon;

    of allspice, a bit of cinnamon, and six cloves, all bruised,
    after having mixed them cold. The jelly should boil fifteen
    minutes without stirring; then clear it through a flannel
    bag.</p>

    <p><b>Cherry Jelly.</b>&mdash;Cherries, 5 lbs.; stone them; red

    <h3>HOW TO SELECT<br />
    AND COOK MEATS</h3>

    <p><b>How to Dress Bacon and Beans</b>&mdash;When you dress
    beans and bacon, boil the bacon by itself, and the beans by
    themselves, for the bacon will spoil the color of the beans.
    Always throw some salt into the water and some parsley nicely
    picked. When the beans are done enough, which you will know by
    their being tender, throw them into a colander to drain. Take
    up the bacon and skin it; throw some raspings of the bread over
    the top, and if you have a salamander, make it red hot, and
    hold it over it to brown the top of the bacon; if you have not
    one, set it before the fire to brown. Lay the beans in the
    dish, and the bacon in the middle on the top, and send them to
    table, with butter in a tureen.</p>

    <p><b>Corned Beef</b>&mdash;Make the following pickle: Water, 2
    gallons; salt, 2-1/2 lbs.; molasses, 1/2 lb.; sugar, 1 lb.;
    saltpetre, 1-1/2 ozs.; pearlash, 1/4 oz. Boil all together;
    skim, and pour the pickle on about 25 lbs. of beef. Let it stay
    in a few days. Boil in plenty of water when cooked to remove
    the salt, and eat with it plenty of vegetables. It is nice to
    eat cold, and makes excellent sandwiches.</p>

    <p><b>Rolled Beef</b>&mdash;Hang three ribs three or four days;
    take out the bones from the whole length, sprinkle it with
    salt, roll the meat tight and roast it. Nothing can look nicer.
    The above done with spices, etc., and baked as hunters' beef is
    excellent.</p>

    <p><b>Beef, Rolled to equal Hare</b>&mdash;Take the inside of a
    large sirloin, soak it in a glass of port wine and a glass of
    vinegar mixed, for forty-eight hours; have ready a very fine
    stuffing, and bind it up tight. Roast it on a hanging spit; and
    baste it with a glass of port wine, the same quantity of
    vinegar, and a teaspoonful of pounded allspice. Larding it
    improves the look and flavor; serve with a rich gravy in the
    dish; currant-jelly and melted butter in tureens.</p>

    <p><b>Round of Beef</b>&mdash;Should be carefully salted and
    wet with the pickle for eight or ten days. The bone should be
    cut out first, and the beef skewered and tied up to make it
    quite round. It may be stuffed with parsley, if approved, in
    which case the holes to admit the parsley must be made with a
    sharp pointed knife, and the parsley coarsely cut and stuffed
    in tight. As soon as it boils, it should be skimmed: and
    afterwards kept boiling very gently.</p>

    <p><b>Beef Steak, Stewed</b>&mdash;Peel and chop two Spanish
    onions, cut into small parts four pickled walnuts, and put them
    at the bottom of a stewpan; add a teacupful of mushroom
    ketchup, two teaspoonfuls of walnut ditto, one of shalot, one
    of Chile vinegar, and a lump of butter. Let the rump-steak be
    cut about three-quarters of an inch thick, and beat it flat
    with a rolling-pin, place the meat on the top of the onions,
    etc., let it stew for one hour and a half, turning it every
    twenty minutes. Ten minutes before serving up, throw a dozen
    oysters with the liquor strained.</p>

    <p><b>Beef Steak and Oyster Sauce</b>&mdash;Select a good,
    tender rump-steak, about an inch thick, and broil it carefully.
    Nothing but experience and attention will serve in broiling a
    steaks; one thing, however, is always to be remembered, never
    malt or season broiled meat until cooked. Have the gridiron
    clean and hot, grease it with either butter, or good lard,
    before laying on the meat, to prevent its sticking or marking
    the meat; have clear, bright coals, and turn it frequently.
    When cooked, cover tightly, and have ready nicely stewed
    oysters; then lay the steak in a hot dish and pour over some of
    the oysters. Serve the rest in a tureen. Twenty-five oysters
    will make a nice sauce for a steak.</p>

    <p><b>Fricassee of Cold Roast Beef</b>&mdash;Cut the beef into
    very thin slices; shred a handful of parsley very small, cut an
    onion into quarters, and put all together into a stewpan, with
    a piece of butter, and some strong broth; season with salt and
    pepper, and simmer very gently a quarter of an hour; then mix
    into it the yolks of two eggs, a glass of port wine, and a
    spoonful of vinegar; stir it quickly, rub the dish with shalot,
    and turn the fricassee into it.</p>

    <p><b>Brawn</b>&mdash;Clean a pig's head, and rub it over with
    salt and a little saltpetre, and let it lie two or three days;
    then boil it until the bones will leave the meat; season with
    salt and pepper, and lay the meat hot in a mold, and press and
    weigh it down for a few hours. Boil another hour, covering. Be
    sure and cut the tongue, and lay the slices in the middle, as
    it much improves the flavor.</p>

    <p><b>Calf's Liver and Bacon</b>&mdash;Cut the liver into
    slices, and fry it first, then the bacon; lay the liver in the
    dish, and the bacon upon it; serve it up with gravy, made in
    the pan with boiling water, thickened with flour and butter,
    and lemon juice; and, if agreeable, a little parsley and onion
    may be chopped into it, or a little boiled parsley strewed over
    the liver. Garnish with slices of lemon.</p>

    <p><b>Nice Form of Cold Meats</b>&mdash;Remains of boiled ham,
    mutton, roast beef, etc., are good chopped fine with hard
    boiled eggs, two heads of lettuce, a bit of onion, and seasoned
    with mustard, oil, vinegar, and, if needed, more salt. Fix it
    smoothly in a salad dish, and adorn the edges with sprigs of
    parsley or leaves of curled lettuce. Keep by the ice or in a
    cool place until wanted.</p>

    <p><b>Fried Ham and Eggs</b>&mdash;Cut thin slices, place in
    the pan, and fry carefully. Do not burn. When done break the
    eggs into the fat; pepper slightly; keep them whole; do not
    turn them.</p>

    <p>Ham Rushers may be served with spinach and poached eggs.</p>

    <p><b>To Cook Ham</b>&mdash;Scrape it clean. Do not put into
    cold nor boiling water. Let the water become warm; then put the
    ham in. Simmer or boil lightly for five or six hours; take out,
    and shave the rind off. Rub granulated sugar into the whole
    surface of the ham, so long as it can be made to receive it.
    Place the ham in a baking-dish with a bottle of champagne or
    prime cider. Baste occasionally with the juice, and let it bake
    an hour in a gentle heat.</p>

    <p>A slice from a nicely cured ham thus cooked is enough to
    animate the ribs of death.</p>

    <p>Or, having taken off the rind, strew bread crumbs or
    raspings over it, so as to cover it; set it before the fire, or
    in the oven till the bread is crisp and brown. Garnish with
    carrots, parsley, etc. The water should simmer all the time,
    and never boil fast.</p>

    <p><b>Ham and Chicken, in Jelly</b>&mdash;This is a nice dish
    for supper or luncheon. Make with a small knuckle of veal some
    good white stock. When cold, skim and strain it; melt it, and
    put a quart of it into a saucepan with the well beaten whites
    of three eggs; a dessert-spoonful of Chili, or a tablespoonful
    of tarragon vinegar, and a little salt. Beat the mixture well
    with a fork till it boils; let it simmer till it is reduced to
    a little more than a pint; strain it; put half of it into a
    mold; let it nearly set. Cut the meat of a roast chicken into
    small thin pieces; arrange it in the jelly with some neat
    little slices of cold boiled ham, and sprinkle chopped parsley
    between the slices. When it has got quite cold, pour in the
    remainder of the jelly, and stand the mold in cold water, or in
    a cool place, so that it
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"
       id="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span> sets speedily. Dip the mold
       in boiling water to turn it out. Do not let it remain in the
       water more than a minute, or it will spoil the appearance of
       the dish. Garnish with a wreath of parsley.</p>

    <p><b>Leg of Lamb</b>&mdash;Should be boiled in a cloth to look
    as white as possible. The loin fried in steaks and served
    round, garnished with dried or fried parsley; spinach to eat
    with it; or dressed separately or roasted.</p>

    <p><b>Loin Of Mutton</b>&mdash;Take off the skin, separate the
    joints with the chopper; if a large size, cut the chine-bone
    with a saw, so as to allow it to be carved in smaller pieces;
    run a small spit from one extremity to the other, and affix it
    to a larger spit, and roast it like the haunch. A loin weighing
    six pounds will take one hour to roast.</p>

    <p><b>Observations on Heat</b>&mdash;In all kinds of
    provisions, the best of the kind goes the farthest; it cuts out
    with most advantage, and affords most nourishment. Round of
    beef, fillet of veal, and leg of mutton, are joints of higher
    price; but as they have more solid meat, they deserve the
    preference. But those joints which are inferior may be dressed
    as palatably.</p>

    <p>In loins of meat, the long pipe that runs by the bone should
    be taken out, as it is apt to taint; as also the kernels of
    beef. Do not purchase joints bruised by the blows of
    drovers.</p>

    <p>Save shank bones of mutton to enrich gravies or soups.</p>

    <p>When sirloins of beef, or loins of veal or mutton, come in,
    part of the suet may be cut off for puddings, or to
    clarify.</p>

    <p>Dripping will baste anything as well as butter; except fowls
    and game; and for kitchen pies, nothing else should be
    used.</p>

    <p>The fat of a neck or loin of mutton makes a far lighter
    pudding than suet.</p>

    <p>Frosted meat and vegetables should be soaked in <i>cold
    water</i> two or three hours before using.</p>

    <p>If the weather permit, meat eats much better for hanging two
    or three days before it is salted.</p>

    <p>Roast-beef bones, or shank bones of ham, make fine
    peas-soup; and should be boiled with the peas the day before
    eaten, that the fat may be taken off.</p>

    <p><b>Boiled Leg of Mutton</b>&mdash;Soak well for an hour or
    two in salt and water; do not use much salt; wipe well and boil
    in a floured cloth. Boil from two hours to two hours and a
    half. Serve with caper sauce, potatoes, mashed turnips, greens,
    oyster sauce, etc.</p>

    <p>To preserve the gravy in the leg, do not put it in the water
    till it boils; for the sudden contact with water causes a
    slight film over the surface, which prevents the escape of the
    gravy, which is abundant when carved.</p>

    <p><b>How to Hash Mutton.</b>&mdash;Cut thin slices of dressed
    mutton, fat and lean; flour them; have ready a little onion
    boiled in two or three spoonfuls of water; add to it a little
    gravy and the meat seasoned, and make it hot, but not to boil.
    Serve in a covered dish. Instead of onion, a clove, a spoonful
    of current jelly, and half a glass of port wine will give an
    agreeable flavor of venison, if the meat be fine.</p>

    <p>Pickled cucumber, or walnut cut small, warm in it for
    change.</p>

    <p><b>How to Prepare Pig's Cheek for Boiling.</b>&mdash;Cut off
    the snout, and clean the head; divide it, and take out the eyes
    and the brains; sprinkle the head with salt, and let it drain
    24 hours. Salt it with common salt and saltpetre; let it lie
    nine days if to be dressed without stewing with peas, but less
    if to be dressed with peas, and it must be washed first, and
    then simmer till all is tender.</p>

    <p><b>Pig's Feet and Ears.</b>&mdash;Clean carefully, and soak
    some hours, and boil them tender; then take them out; boil some
    vinegar and a little salt with some of the water, and when cold
    put it over them. When they are to be dressed, dry them, cut
    the feet in two, and slice the ears; fry, and serve with
    butter, mustard and vinegar. They may be either done in batter,
    or only floured.</p>

    <p><b>Pork, Loin Of.</b>&mdash;Score it, and joint it, that the
    chops may separate easily; and then roast it as a loin of
    mutton. Or, put it into sufficient water to cover it; simmer
    till almost enough; then peel off the skin, and coat it with
    yolk of egg and bread crumbs, and roast for 15 or 20 minutes,
    till it is done enough.</p>

    <p><b>How to Pickle Pork.</b>&mdash;Cut the pork in such pieces
    as will lie in the pickling tub; rub each piece with saltpetre;
    then take one part bay salt, and two parts common salt, and rub
    each piece well; lay them close in the tub, and throw salt over
    them.</p>

    <p>Some use a little sal prunnella, and a little sugar.</p>

    <p><b>Pork Pie, to Eat Cold.</b>&mdash;Raise a common boiled
    crust into either a round or oval form, which you choose, have
    ready the trimmings and small bits of pork cut off a sweet
    bone, when the hog is killed, beat it with a rolling-pin,
    season with pepper and salt, and keep the fat and lean
    separate, put it in layers quite close to the top, lay on the
    lid, cut the edge smooth, round, and pinch it; bake in a
    slow-soaking oven, as the meat is very solid. Observe, put no
    bone or water in the pork pie; the outside pieces will be hard
    if they are not cut small and pressed close.</p>

    <p><b>How to Roast a Leg of Pork.</b>&mdash;Choose a small leg
    of fine young pork; cut a slit in the knuckle with a sharp
    knife; and fill the space with sage and onion chopped, and a
    little pepper and salt. When half done, score the skin in
    slices, but don't cut deeper than the outer rind.</p>

    <p>Apple sauce and potatoes should be served to eat with
    it.</p>

    <p><b>Pork, Rolled Neck of.</b>&mdash;Bone it; put a forcemeat
    of chopped sage, a very few crumbs of bread, salt, pepper and
    two or three berries of allspice over the inside; then roll the
    meat as tight as you can, and roast it slowly, and at a good
    distance at first.</p>

    <p><b>Chine of Pork.</b>&mdash;Salt three days before cooking.
    Wash it well; score the skin, and roast with sage and onions
    finely shred. Serve with apple sauce.&mdash;The chine is often
    sent to the table boiled.</p>

    <p><b>How to Collar Pork.</b>&mdash;Bone a breast or spring of
    pork; season it with plenty of thyme, parsley and sage; roll it
    hard; put in a cloth, tie both ends, and boil it; then press
    it; when cold, take it out of the cloth, and keep it in its own
    liquor.</p>

    <p><b>Pork as Lamb.</b>&mdash;Kill a young pig of four or five
    months old: cut up the forequarter for roasting as you do lamb,
    and truss the shank close. The other parts will make delicate
    pickled pork; or steaks, pies, etc.</p>

    <p><b>Pork Sausages.</b>&mdash;Take 6 lbs. of young pork, free
    from gristle, or fat; cut small and beat fine in a mortar. Chop
    6 lbs. of beef suet very fine; pick off the leaves of a
    hand-full of sage, and shred it fine; spread the meat on a
    clean dresser, and shake the sage over the meat; shred the rind
    of a lemon very fine, and throw it, with sweet herbs, on the
    meat; grate two nutmegs, to which put a spoonful of pepper, and
    a large spoonful of salt: throw the suet over, and mix all well
    together. Put it down close in the pot; and when you use it,
    roll it up with as much egg as will make it roll smooth.</p>

    <p><b>Sausage Rolls.</b>&mdash;One pound of flour, half a pound
    of the best lard, quarter of a pound of butter, and the yolks
    of three eggs well beaten. Put the flour into a dish, make a
    hole in the middle of it, and rub in about one ounce of the
    lard, then the yolks of the eggs, and enough water to mix the
    whole into a smooth paste. Roll it out about an
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"
       id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span> inch thick; flour your
       paste and board. Put the butter and lard in a lump into the
       paste, sprinkle it with flour, and turn the paste over it;
       beat it with a rolling-pin until you have got it flat enough
       to roll; roll it lightly until very thin; then divide your
       meat and put it into two layers of paste, and pinch the
       ends. Sausage rolls are now usually made small. Two pounds
       of sausage meat will be required for this quantity of paste,
       and it will make about two and a half dozen of rolls. Whites
       of the eggs should be beaten a little, and brushed over the
       rolls to glaze them. They will require from twenty minutes
       to half an hour to bake, and should be served on a dish
       covered with a neatly-folded napkin.</p>

    <p><b>Spiced Beef.</b>&mdash;Take a round of an ox; or young
    heifer, from 20 to 40 lbs. Cut it neatly, so that the thin
    flank end can wrap nearly round. Take from 2 to 4 ounces
    salpetre, and 1 ounce of coarse sugar, and two handfuls of
    common salt. Mix them well together and rub it all over. The
    next day salt it well as for boiling. Let it lie from two to
    three weeks, turning it every two or three days. Take out of
    the pickle, and wipe it dry. Then take cloves, mace, well
    powdered, a spoonful of gravy, and rub it well into the beef.
    Roll it up as tightly as possible; skewer it, and tie it up
    tight. Pour in the liquor till the meat is quite saturated, in
    which state it must be kept.</p>

    <p><b>Stewed Beef.</b>&mdash;Take five pounds of buttock, place
    it in a deep dish; half a pint of white wine vinegar, three bay
    leaves, two or three cloves, salt and pepper; turn it over
    twice the first day, and every morning after for a week or ten
    days. Boil half a pound or a quarter of a pound of butter, and
    throw in two onions, chopped very small, four cloves, and some
    pepper-corns; stew five hours till tender and a nice light
    brown.</p>

    <p><b>How to Boil Tongue.</b>&mdash;If the tongue be a dry one,
    steep in water all night. Boil it three hours. If you prefer it
    hot, stick it with cloves. Clear off the scum, and add savory
    herbs when it has boiled two hours; but this is optional. Rub
    it over with the yolk of an egg; strew over it bread crumbs;
    baste it with butter; set it before the fire till it is of a
    light brown. When you dish it up, pour a little brown gravy, or
    port wine sauce mixed the same way as for venison. Lay slices
    of currant jelly around it.</p>

    <p><b>How to Fricassee Tripe.</b>&mdash;Cut into small square
    pieces. Put them into the stewpan with as much sherry as will
    cover them, with pepper, ginger, a blade of mace, sweet herbs
    and an onion. Stew 15 minutes. Take out the herbs and onion,
    and put in a little shred of parsley, the juice of a small
    lemon, half an anchovy cut small, a gill of cream and a little
    butter, or yolk of an egg. Garnish with lemon.</p>

    <p><b>How to Fry Tripe.</b>&mdash;Cut the tripe into small
    square pieces; dip them in yolks of eggs, and fry them in good
    dripping, till nicely brown; take out and drain, and serve with
    plain melted butter.</p>

    <p><b>Veal Cutlets, Maintenon.</b>&mdash;Cut slices about three
    quarters of an inch thick, beat them with a rolling-pin, and
    wet them on both sides with egg; dip them into a seasoning of
    bread crumbs, parsley, thyme, knotted marjoram, pepper, salt
    and a little nutmeg grated; then put them in papers folded
    over, and broil them; and serve with a boat of melted butter,
    with a little mushroom ketchup.</p>

    <p><b>Veal Cutlets.</b>&mdash;Another way.&mdash;Prepare as
    above, and fry them; lay into a dish, and keep them hot; dredge
    a little flour, and put a bit of butter into the pan; brown it,
    then pour some boiling water into it and boil quickly; season
    with pepper, salt and ketchup and pour over them.</p>

    <p><b>Another Way.</b>&mdash;Prepare as before, and dress the
    cutlets in a dutch oven; pour over them melted butter and
    mushrooms.</p>

    <p><b>Fillet Of Veal.</b>&mdash;Veal requires a good, bright
    fire for roasting. Before cooking, stuff with a force-meat,
    composed of 2 ozs. of finely-powdered bread crumbs, half a
    lemon-peel chopped fine, half a teaspoonful of salt, and the
    same quantity of mixed mace and cayenne pepper, powdered
    parsley, and some sweet herbs; break an egg, and mix all well
    together. Baste your joint with fresh butter, and send it to
    table well browned. A nice bit of bacon should be served with
    the fillet of veal, unless ham is provided.</p>

    <p><b>Veal Patties.</b>&mdash;Mince some veal that is not quite
    done with a little parsley, lemon-peel, a scrape of nutmeg, and
    a bit of salt; add a little cream and gravy just to moisten the
    meat; and add a little ham. Do not warm it till the patties are
    baked.</p>

    <p><b>Veal Pie.</b>&mdash;Take some of the middle, or scrag, of
    a small neck; season it; and either put to it, or not, a few
    slices of lean bacon or ham. If it is wanted of a high relish,
    add mace, cayenne, and nutmeg, to the salt and pepper; and also
    force-meat and eggs; and if you choose, add truffles, morels,
    mushrooms, sweet-bread, cut into small bits, and cocks'-combs
    blanched, if liked. Have a rich gravy ready, to pour in after
    baking. It will be very good without any of the latter
    additions.</p>

    <p><b>Common Veal Pie.</b>&mdash;Cut a breast of veal into
    pieces; season with pepper and salt, and lay them in the dish.
    Boil hard six or eight yolks of eggs, and put them into
    different places in the pie; pour in as much water as will
    nearly fill the dish; put on the lid, and bake. <i>Lamb Pie</i>
    may be done this way.</p>

    <p><b>Stewed Veal.</b>&mdash;Cut the veal as for small cutlets;
    put into the bottom of a pie-dish a layer of the veal, and
    sprinkle it with some finely-rubbed sweet basil and chopped
    parsley, the grated rind of one lemon with the juice, half a
    nut-meg, grated, a little salt and pepper; and cut into very
    small <ins class="correction"
    title="Transcribers's Note: The original text reads 'peices'.">
    pieces</ins> a large spoonful of butter; then another layer of
    slices of veal, with exactly the same seasoning as before; and
     over this pour one pint of Lisbon wine and half a pint of
     cold water; then cover it over very thickly with grated
     stale bread; put this in the oven and bake slowly for
     three-quarters of an hour, and brown it. Serve it in a
     pie-dish hot.</p>

    <p><b>Breast of Veal Stuffed</b>&mdash;Cut off the gristle of a
    breast of veal, and raise the meat off the bones, then lay a
    good force-meat, made of pounded veal, some sausage-meat,
    parsley, and a few shalots chopped very fine, and well seasoned
    with pepper, salt, and nutmeg; then roll the veal tightly, and
    sew it with fine twine to keep it in shape, and prevent the
    force-meat escaping; lay some slices of fat bacon in a
    stew-pan, and put the veal roll on it; add some stock, pepper,
    salt, and a bunch of sweet herbs; let it stew three hours, then
    cut carefully out the twine, strain the sauce after skimming it
    well, thicken it with brown flour; let it boil up once, and
    pour it over the veal garnish with slices of lemon, each cut in
    four. A fillet of veal first stuffed with force-meat can be
    dressed in the same manner, but is must first be roasted, so as
    to brown it a good color; and force-meat balls, highly
    seasoned, should be served round the veal.</p>

    <h3>HOW TO MAKE PIES<br />
     OF VARIOUS KINDS</h3>

    <p><b>Beef-Steak Pie</b>&mdash;Prepare the steaks as stated
    under <i>Beefsteaks</i>, and when seasoned and rolled with fat
    in each, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page114"
       id="page114"></a>[pg 114]</span> put them in a dish with
       puff paste round the edges; put a little water in the dish,
       and cover it with a good crust.</p>

    <p><b>Chicken Pie</b>&mdash;Cut the chicken in pieces, and boil
    nearly tender. Make a rich crust with an egg or two to make it
    light and puffy. Season the chicken and slices of ham with
    pepper, salt, mace, nutmeg, and cayenne. Put them in layers,
    first the ham, chicken, force-meat balls, and hard eggs in
    layers. Make a gravy of knuckle of veal, mutton bones, seasoned
    with herbs, onions, pepper, etc. Pour it over the contents of
    the pie, and cover with paste. Bake an hour.</p>

    <p><b>Cocoanut Pie</b>&mdash;Take a teacup of cocoanut, put it
    into a coffee-cup, fill it up with sweet milk, and let it soak
    a few hours. When ready to bake the pie, take two
    tablespoonfuls of flour, mix with milk, and stir in
    three-fourths of a cup of milk (or water); place on the stove,
    and stir until it thickens. Add butter the size of a walnut,
    while warm. When cool, add a little salt, two eggs, saving out
    the white of one for the top. Sweeten to taste. Add the
    cocoanut, beating well. Fill the crust and bake. When done,
    have the extra white beaten ready to spread over the top.
    Return to the oven and brown lightly.</p>

    <p><b>Cream Pie</b>&mdash;Take eight eggs, eight ounces pounded
    sugar, eight ounces flour, put all together into a stew-pan
    with two glasses of milk, stir until it boils, then add quarter
    pound of butter, and quarter pound of almonds, chopped fine;
    mix well together, make paste, roll it out half an inch thick,
    cut out a piece the size of a teaplate, put in a baking tin,
    spread out on it the cream, and lay strips of paste across each
    way and a plain broad piece around the edge, egg and sugar the
    top and bake in a quick oven.</p>

    <p><b>Fish Pie</b>&mdash;Pike, perch and carp may be made into
    very savory pies if cut into fillets, seasoned and baked in
    paste, sauce made of veal broth, or cream put in before
    baking.</p>

    <p><b>Game Pie</b>&mdash;Divide the birds, if large, into
    pieces or joints. They may be pheasants, partridges, etc. Add a
    little bacon or ham. Season well. Cover with puff paste, and
    bake carefully. Pour into the pie half a cupful of melted
    butter, the juice of a lemon, and a glass of sherry, when
    rather more than half baked.</p>

    <p><b>Giblet Pie</b>&mdash;Clean the giblets well; stew with a
    little water, onion, pepper, salt, sweet herbs, till nearly
    done. Cool, and add beef, veal or mutton steaks. Put the liquor
    of the stew to the giblets. Cover with paste, and when the pie
    is baked, pour into it a large teacupful of cream.</p>

    <p><b>Lamb Pasty</b>&mdash;Bone the lamb, cut it into square
    pieces; season with salt, pepper, cloves, mace, nutmeg, and
    minced thyme; lay in some beef suet, and the lamb upon it,
    making a high border about it; then turn over the paste close,
    and bake it. When it is enough, put in some claret, sugar,
    vinegar, and the yolks of eggs, beaten, together. To have the
    sauce only savory, and not sweet, let it be gravy only, or the
    baking of bones in claret.</p>

    <p><b>Salmon Pie.</b>&mdash;Grate the rind of one small lemon,
    or half a large one; beat the yolks of 2 eggs; 4 tablespoons of
    sugar; beat all together; add to this 1/2 pint of cold water,
    with 1-1/2 tablespoons of flour in it; rub smooth so there will
    be no lumps; beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth; stir
    this in your pie-custard before you put it in the pan. Bake
    with one crust, and bake slowly.</p>

    <p><b>Salmon Pie</b>&mdash;Grate the rind of a lemon into the
    yolks of three fresh eggs; beat for five minutes, adding three
    heaping tablespoonfuls of granulated sugar; after squeezing in
    the juice of the lemon add half a teacupful of water; mix all
    thoroughly, and place in a crust the same as made for custard
    pie; place in oven and bake slowly. Take the whites of the
    three eggs, and beat to a stiff froth, adding two
    tablespoonfuls of pulverized sugar, and juice of half a lemon;
    after the pie bakes and is cool, place the frosting on top, and
    put into a hot oven to brown.</p>

    <p><b>Mince-Meat</b>&mdash;There are various opinions as to the
    result of adding meat to the sweet ingredients used in making
    this favorite dish. Many housewives think it an improvement,
    and use either the under-cut of a well-roasted surloin of beef
    or a boiled fresh ox-tongue for the purpose. Either of these
    meats may be chosen with advantage, and one pound, after it has
    been cooked, will be found sufficient; this should be freed
    from fat, and well minced. In making mince-meat, each
    ingredient should be minced separately and finely before it is
    added to the others. For a moderate quantity, take two pounds
    of raisins (stoned), the same quantity of currants, well washed
    and dried, ditto of beef suet, chopped fine, one pound of
    American apples, pared and cored, two pounds of moist sugar,
    half a pound of candied orange-peel, and a quarter of a pound
    of citron, the grated rinds of three lemons, one grated nutmeg,
    a little mace, half an ounce of salt, and one teaspoonful of
    ginger. After having minced the fruit separately, mix all well
    together with the hand; then add half a pint of French brandy
    and the same of sherry. Mix well with a spoon, press it down in
    jars, and cover it with a bladder.</p>

    <p><b>Good Mince Pies.</b>&mdash;Six pounds beef; 5 pounds
    suet; 5 pounds sugar; 2 ounces allspice; 2 ounces cloves; 3/4
    pound cinnamon; 1/2 pint molasses; 1-1/4 pounds seedless
    raisins; 2 pounds currants; 1/2 pound citron chopped fine; 1
    pound almonds, chopped fine; 2 oranges; 1 lemon-skin, and all
    chopped fine; 2 parts chopped apples to one of meat; brandy and
    cider to taste.</p>

    <p><b>Mock Mince Pies.</b>&mdash;One teacup of bread; one of
    vinegar; one of water; one of raisins; one of sugar; one of
    molasses; one half-cup of butter; one teaspoon of cloves; one
    of nutmeg; one of cinnamon. The quantity is sufficient for
    three pies. They are equally as good as those made in the usual
    way.</p>

    <p><b>Potato Pasty.</b>&mdash;Boil and peel and mash potatoes
    as fine as possible; mix them with salt, pepper, and a good bit
    of butter. Make a paste; roll it out thin like a large puff,
    and put in the potato; fold over one half, pinching the edges.
    Bake in a moderate oven.</p>

    <p><b>Potato Pie.</b>&mdash;Skin some potatoes and cut them in
    slices; season them; and also some mutton, beef, pork or veal,
    and a lump of butter. Put layers of them and of the meat. A few
    eggs boiled and chopped fine improves it.</p>

    <p><b>Veal and Ham Pie.</b>&mdash;Cut about one pound and a
    half of veal into thin slices, as also a quarter of a pound of
    cooked ham; season the veal rather highly with white pepper and
    salt, with which cover the bottom of the dish; then lay over a
    few slices of ham, then the remainder of the veal, finishing
    with the remainder of the ham; add a wineglassful of water, and
    cover with a good paste, and bake; a bay-leaf will be an
    improvement.</p>

    <p><b>Vinegar Pie.</b>&mdash;Five tablespoons vinegar, five
    sugar, two flour, two water, a little nutmeg. Put in dish and
    bake.</p>

    <h3>HOW TO MAKE PRESERVES<br />
    OF VARIOUS KINDS</h3>

    <p><b>Apple Jam.</b>&mdash;Fill a wide jar nearly half full of
    water; cut the apples unpeeled into quarters, take out the
    core, then fill the jar with the apples; tie a paper over it,
    and put it into a slow oven. When quite soft and cool, pulp
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"
       id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span> them through a sieve. To
       each pound of pulp put three-quarters of a pound of crushed
       sugar, and boil it gently until it will jelly. Put it into
       large tart dishes or jars. It will keep for five or more
       years in a cool, dry place. If for present use, or a month
       hence, half a pound of sugar is enough.</p>

    <p><b>Apple Marmalade.</b>&mdash;Scald apples till they will
    pulp from the core; then take an equal weight of sugar in large
    lumps, just dip them in water, and boil it till it can be well
    skimmed, and is a thick syrup, put to it the pulp, and simmer
    it on a quick fire a quarter of an hour. Grate a little
    lemon-peel before boiled, but if too much it will be
    bitter.</p>

    <p><b>Barberry Jam.</b>&mdash;The barberries for this preserve
    should be quite ripe, though they should not be allowed to hang
    until they begin to decay. Strip them from the stalks; throw
    aside such as are spotted, and for one pound of fruit allow
    eighteen ounces well-refined sugar; boil this, with about a
    pint of water to every four pounds, until it becomes white, and
    falls in thick masses from the spoon; then throw in the fruit,
    and keep it stirred over a brisk fire for six minutes only;
    take off the scum, and pour it into jars or glasses. Sugar four
    and a half pounds; water a pint and a quarter, boil to candy
    height; barberries four pounds; six minutes.</p>

    <p><b>How to Preserve Blackcurrants.</b>&mdash;Get the currants
    when they are dry, and pick them; to every 1-1/4 lbs. of
    currants put 1 lb. of sugar into a preserving pan, with as much
    juice of currants as will dissolve it; when it boils skim it,
    and put in the currants, and boil them till they are clear; put
    them into a jar, lay brandy paper over them, tie them down, and
    keep in a dry place. A little raspberry juice is an
    improvement.</p>

    <p><b>Cherry Jam.</b>&mdash;Pick and stone 4 lbs. of May-duke
    cherries; press them through a sieve; then boil together half a
    pint of red currant or raspberry juice, and 3/4 lb. of white
    sugar, put the cherries into them while boiling; add 1 lb. of
    fine white sugar. Boil quickly 35 minutes, jar, and cover
    well.</p>

    <p><b>Cherry Marmalade.</b>&mdash;Take some very ripe cherries;
    cut off the stalks and take out the stones; crush them and boil
    them well; put them into a hand sieve, and force them through
    with a spatula, till the whole is pressed through and nothing
    remains but the skins; put it again upon the fire to dry; when
    reduced to half weigh it, and add an equal weight of sugar;
    boil again; and when it threads between the fingers, it is
    finished.</p>

    <p><b>How to Preserve Currants for Tarts.</b>&mdash;Let the
    currants be ripe, dry and well picked. To every 1-1/4 lbs. of
    currants put 1 lb. of sugar into a preserving pan with as much
    juice of currants as will dissolve it; when it boils skim it,
    and put in the currants; boil till clear; jar, and put
    brandy-paper over; tie down; keep in a dry place.</p>

    <p><b>How to Preserve Grapes.</b>&mdash;Into an air-tight cask
    put a layer of bran dried in an oven; upon this place a layer
    of grapes, well dried, and not quite ripe, and so on
    alternately till the barrel is filled; end with bran, and close
    air-tight; they will keep 9 or 10 months. To restore them to
    their original freshness, cut the end off each bunch stalk, and
    put into wine, like flowers. Or,</p>

    <p>Bunches of grapes may be preserved through winter by
    inserting the end of the stem into a potato. The bunches should
    be laid on dry straw, and turned occasionally.</p>

    <p><b>How to Preserve Green Gages.</b>&mdash;Choose the largest
    when they begin to soften; split them without paring; strew
    upon them part of the sugar. Blanch the kernels with a sharp
    knife. Next day pour the syrup from the fruit, and boil it with
    the other sugar six or eight minutes gently; skim and add the
    plums and kernels. Simmer till clear, taking off the scum; put
    the fruit singly into small pots, and pour the syrup and
    kernels to it. To candy it, do not add the syrup, but observe
    the directions given for candying fruit; some may be done each
    way.</p>

    <p><b>Green Gage Jam.</b>&mdash;Peel and take out the stones.
    To 1 lb. of pulp put 3/4 lb. loaf sugar; boil half an hour; add
    lemon juice.</p>

    <p><b>Transparently Beautiful Marmalade.</b>&mdash;Take 3 lbs.
    bitter oranges; pare them as you would potatoes; cut the skin
    into fine shreds, and put them into a muslin bag; quarter all
    the oranges; press out the juice. Boil the pulp and shreds in
    three quarts of water 2-1/2 hours, down to three pints; strain
    through a hair sieve. Then put six pounds of sugar to the
    liquid, the juice and the shreds, the outside of two lemons
    grated, and the insides squeezed in; add three cents worth of
    isinglass. Simmer altogether slowly for 15 or 20 minutes.</p>

    <p><b>Tomato Marmalade.</b>&mdash;Take ripe tomatoes in the
    height of the season; weigh them, and to every pound of
    tomatoes add one pound of sugar. Put the tomatoes into a large
    pan or small tub, and scald them with boiling water, so as to
    make the skin peel off easily; When you have entirely removed
    the skin, put the tomatoes (without any water) into a
    preserving kettle, wash them, and add the sugar, with one ounce
    of powdered ginger to every three pounds of fruit, and the
    juice of two lemons, the grated rind of three always to every
    three pounds of fruit. Stir up the whole together, and set it
    over a moderate fire. Boil it gently for two or three hours;
    till the whole becomes a thick, smooth mass, skimming it well,
    and stirring it to the bottom after every skimming. When done,
    put it warm into jars, and cover tightly. This will be found a
    very fine sweetmeat.</p>

    <p><b>How to Preserve Green Peas.</b>&mdash;Shell, and put them
    into a kettle of water when it boils; give them two or three
    warms only, and pour them in a colander. Drain, and turn them
    out on a cloth, and then on another to dry perfectly. When dry
    bottle them in wide mouthed bottles; leaving only room to pour
    clarified mutton suet upon them an inch thick, and for the
    cork. Rosin it down; and keep in the cellar, or in the earth,
    as directed for gooseberries. When they are to be used, boil
    them till tender, with a bit of butter, a spoonful of sugar,
    and a bit of mint.</p>

    <p><b>How to Preserve Green Peas for Winter
    Use.</b>&mdash;Carefully shell the peas; then place them in the
    canister, not too large ones; put in a small piece of alum,
    about the size of a horse-bean to a pint of peas. When the
    canister is full of peas, fill up the interstices with water,
    and solder on the lid perfectly air-tight, and boil the
    canisters for about twenty minutes; then remove them to a cool
    place, and by the time of January they will be found but little
    inferior to fresh, new-gathered peas. Bottling is not so good;
    at least, we have not found it so; for the air gets in, the
    liquid turns sour, and the peas acquire a bad taste.</p>

    <p><b>How to Keep Preserves.</b>&mdash;Apply the white of an
    egg, with a brush, to a single thickness of white tissue paper,
    with which covers the jars, lapping over an inch or two. It
    will require no tying, as it will become, when dry,
    inconceivably tight and strong, and impervious to the air.</p>

    <p><b>Quinces for the Tea-table.</b>&mdash;Bake ripe quinces
    thoroughly; when cold, strip off the skins, place them in a
    glass dish, and sprinkle with white sugar, and serve them with
    cream. They make a fine looking dish for the tea-table, and a
    more luscious and inexpensive one than the same fruit made into
    sweetmeats. Those who once taste the fruit thus prepared, will
    probably desire to store away a few bushels in the fall to use
    in the above manner.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"
       id="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span>

    <p><b>Pickled Pears.</b>&mdash;Three pounds of sugar to a pint
    of vinegar, spice in a bag and boil, then cook the pears in the
    vinegar till done through.</p>

    <p><b>Boiled Pears.</b>&mdash;Boil pears in water till soft,
    then add one pound of sugar to three pounds of fruit.</p>

    <p><b>Pickled Citron.</b>&mdash;One quart vinegar, two pounds
    sugar, cloves and cinnamon each one tablespoon, boil the citron
    tender in water, take them out and drain, then put them in the
    syrup and cook till done.</p>

    <p><b>How to Preserve Raspberries.</b>&mdash;Take raspberries
    that are not too ripe, and put them to their weight in sugar,
    with a little water. Boil softly, and do not break them; when
    they are clear, take them up, and boil the syrup till it be
    thick enough; then put them in again, and when they are cold,
    put them in glasses or jars.</p>

    <p><b>Raspberry Jam.</b>&mdash;One pound sugar to four pounds
    fruit, with a few currants.</p>

    <p><b>Spiced Currants.</b>&mdash;Six pounds currants, four
    pounds sugar, two tablespoons cloves and two of cinnamon, and
    one pint of vinegar; boil two hours until quite thick.</p>

    <p><b>Stewed Pears</b>&mdash;Pare and halve or quarter a dozen
    pears, according to their size; carefully remove the cores, but
    leave the sloths on. Place them in a clean baking-jar, with a
    closely fitting lid; add to them the rind of one lemon, cut in
    strips, and the juice of half a lemon, six cloves, and whole
    allspice, according to discretion. Put in just enough water to
    cover the whole, and allow half a pound of loaf-sugar to every
    pint. Cover down close, and bake in a very cool oven for five
    hours, or stew them very gently in a lined saucepan from three
    to four hours. When done, lift them out on a glass dish without
    breaking them; boil up the syrup quickly for two or three
    minutes; let it cool a little, and pour it over the pears. A
    little cochineal greatly enhances the appearance of the fruit;
    you may add a few drops of prepared cochineal; and a little
    port wine is often used, and much improves the flavor.</p>

    <p><b>How to Preserve Whole Strawberries</b>&mdash;Take equal
    weights of the fruit and refined sugar, lay the former in a
    large dish, and sprinkle half the sugar in fine powder over,
    give a gentle shake to the dish that the sugar may touch the
    whole of the fruit; next day make a thin syrup with the
    remainder of the sugar, and instead of water allow one pint of
    red currant juice to every pound of strawberries; in this
    simmer them until sufficiently jellied. Choose the largest
    scarlets, or others when not dead ripe.</p>

    <p><b>How to Preserve Strawberries in Wine</b>&mdash;Put a
    quantity of the finest large strawberries into a
    gooseberry-bottle, and strew in three large spoonfuls of fine
    sugar; fill up with Madeira wine or fine sherry.</p>

    <p><b>Preserved Tomatoes</b>&mdash;One pound of sugar to one
    pound of ripe tomatoes boiled down; flavor with lemon.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>HOW TO BOIL, BAKE AND STEAM<br />
    PUDDINGS</h3>

    <p><b>Amber Pudding</b>&mdash;Put a pound of butter into a
    saucepan, with three quarters of a pound of loaf sugar finely
    powdered; melt the butter, and mix well with it; then add the
    yolks of fifteen eggs well beaten, and as much fresh candied
    orange as will add color and flavor to it, being first beaten
    to a fine paste. Line the dish with paste for turning out; and
    when filled with the above, lay a crust over, as you would a
    pie, and bake in a slow oven. It is as good cold as hot.</p>

    <p><b>Baked Apple Pudding</b>&mdash;Pare and quarter four large
    apples; boil them tender with the rind of a lemon, in so little
    water, that when done, none may remain; beat them quite fine in
    a mortar; add the crumbs of a small roll, four ounces of butter
    melted, the yolks of five, and whites of three eggs, juice of
    half a lemon, and sugar to taste: beat all together, and lay it
    in a dish with paste to turn out.</p>

    <p><b>Boiled Apple Pudding</b>&mdash;Suet, 5 ozs.; flour, 8
    ozs.; chop the suet very fine, and roll it into the flour. Make
    it into a light paste with water. Roll out. Pare and core 8
    good sized apples; slice them; put them on the paste, and
    scatter upon them 4 lb. of sugar; draw the paste round the
    apples, and boil two hours or more, in a well floured cloth.
    Serve with melted butter sweetened.</p>

    <p><b>Swiss Apple Pudding</b>&mdash;Butter a deep dish; put
    into it a layer of bread crumbs; then a layer of finely chopped
    suet; a thick layer of finely chopped apples, and a thick layer
    of sugar. Repeat from the first layer till the dish is full,
    the last layer to be finger biscuits soaked in milk. Cover it
    till nearly enough; then uncover, till the top is nicely
    browned. Flavor with cinnamon, nutmeg, etc., as you please.
    Bake from 30 to 40 minutes.</p>

    <p><b>Apple and Sago Pudding</b>&mdash;Boil a cup of sago in
    boiling water with a little cinnamon, a cup of sugar, lemon
    flavoring; cut apples in thin slices, mix them with the sago;
    after it is well boiled add a small piece of butter: pour into
    a pudding dish and bake half an hour.</p>

    <p><b>Apple Pudding</b>&mdash;Pare and stew three pints of
    apples, mash them, and add four eggs, a quarter of a pound of
    butter, sugar and nutmeg, or grated lemon. Bake it on a short
    crust.</p>

    <p><b>Apple Potatoe Pudding.</b>&mdash;Six potatoes boiled and
    mashed fine,add a little salt and piece of butter, size of an
    egg, roll this out with a little flour, enough to make a good
    pastry crust which is for the outside of the dumpling, into
    this put peeled and chopped apples, roll up like any apple
    dumpling, steam one hour, eat hot with liquid sauce.</p>

    <p><b>Arrow-root Pudding.</b>&mdash;Take 2 teacupfuls of
    arrowroot, and mix it with half a pint of old milk; boil
    another half pint of milk, flavoring it with cinnamon, nutmeg
    or lemon peel, stir the arrowroot and milk into the boiling
    milk. When cold, add the yolks of 3 eggs beaten into 3 ozs. of
    sugar. Then add the whites beaten to a stiff broth, and bake in
    a buttered dish an hour. Ornament the tops with sweetmeats, or
    citron sliced.</p>

    <p><b>Aunt Nelly's Pudding</b>&mdash;Half a pound of flour,
    half pound of treacle, six ounces of chopped suet, the juice
    and peel of one lemon, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream, two or three
    eggs. Mix and beat all together. Boil in a basin (previously
    well buttered) four hours.&mdash;For sauce, melted butter, a
    wine-glassful of sherry, and two or three tablespoonfuls of
    apricot jam.</p>

    <p><b>Baked Indian Pudding.</b>&mdash;Two quarts sweet milk; 1
    pint New Orleans molasses; 1 pint Indian meal: 1 tablespoonful
    butter; nutmeg or cinnamon. Boil the milk; pour it over the
    meal and molasses; add salt and spice; bake three hours. This
    is a large family pudding.</p>

    <p><b>Batter, to be used with all Sorts of Roasting
    Meat.</b>&mdash;Melt good butter; put to it three eggs, with
    the whites well beaten up, and warm them together, stirring
    them continually. With this you may baste any roasting meat,
    and then sprinkle bread crumbs thereon; and so continue to make
    a crust as thick as you please.</p>

    <p><b>Batter, for Frying Fruit, Vegetables, etc.</b>&mdash;Cut
    four ounces of fresh butter into small pieces, pour on it half
    a pint of barley water, and when dissolved, add a pint of cold
    water; mix by degrees with a pound of fine dry flour, and a
    small pinch of salt. Just before it is used,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"
       id="page117"></a>[pg 117]</span> stir into it the whites of
       two eggs beaten to a solid froth; use quickly, that the
       batter may be light.</p>

    <p><b>Beef Steak Pudding.</b>&mdash;Take some fine rump steaks;
    roll them with fat between; and if you approve a little shred
    onion. Lay a paste of suet in a basin, and put in the chopped
    steaks; cover the basin with a suet paste, and pinch the edges
    to keep the gravy in. Cover with a cloth tied close, let the
    pudding boil slowly for two hours.</p>

    <p><b>Baked Beef Steak Pudding.</b>&mdash;Make a batter of
    milk, two eggs and flour, or, which is much better, potatoes
    boiled and mashed through a colander; lay a little of it at the
    bottom of the dish; then put in the steaks very well seasoned;
    pour the remainder of the batter over them, and bake it.</p>

    <p><b>Beef Steak Pudding.</b>&mdash;Prepare a good suet crust,
    and line a cake-tin with it; put in layers of steak with
    onions, tomatoes, and mushrooms, chopped fine, a seasoning of
    pepper, salt and cayenne, and half a cup of water before you
    close it. Bake from an hour and a half to two hours, according
    to the size of the pudding and serve very hot.</p>

    <p><b>Black Cap Pudding..</b>&mdash;Make a batter with milk,
    flour and eggs; butter a basin; pour in the batter, and 5 or 6
    ounces of well-cleaned currants. Cover it with a cloth well
    floured, and tie the cloth very tight. Boil nearly one hour.
    The currants will have settled to the bottom; therefore dish it
    bottom upwards. Serve with sweet sauce and a little rum.</p>

    <p><b>Oswego Blanc Mange.</b>&mdash;Four tablespoonfuls or
    three ounces of Oswego prepared corn to one quart of milk.
    Dissolve the corn to some of the milk. Put into the remainder
    of the milk four ounces of sugar, a little salt, apiece of
    lemon rind, or cinnamon stick, and heat to <i>near</i> boiling.
    Then add the mixed corn, and boil (stirring it briskly) four
    minutes; take out the rind, and pour into a mold or cup, and
    keep until cold. When turned out, pour round it any kind of
    stewed or preserved fruits, or a sauce of milk and sugar.</p>

    <p><b>Nice Blanc-Mange.</b>&mdash;Swell four ounces of rice in
    water; drain and boil it to a mash in good milk, with sugar, a
    bit of lemon peel, and a stick of cinnamon. Take care it does
    not burn, and when quite soft pour it into cups, or into a
    shape dipped into cold water. When cold turn it out, garnish
    with currant jelly, or any red preserved fruit. Serve with
    cream or plain custard.</p>

    <p><b>Boiled Batter Pudding.</b>&mdash;Three eggs, one ounce of
    butter, one pint of milk, three tablespoonfuls of flour, a
    little salt. Put the flour into a basin, and add sufficient
    milk to moisten it; carefully rub down all the lumps with a
    spoon, then pour in the remainder of the milk, and stir in the
    butter, which should be previously melted; keep beating the
    mixture, add the eggs and a pinch of salt, and when the batter
    is quite smooth, put into a well-buttered basin, tie it down
    very tightly, and put it into boiling water; move the basin
    about for a few minutes after it is put into the water, to
    prevent the flour settling in any part, and boil for one hour
    and a quarter. This pudding may also be boiled in a floured
    cloth that has been wetted in hot water; it will then take a
    few minutes less than when boiled in a basin. Send these
    puddings very quickly to table, and serve with sweet sauce,
    wine-sauce, stewed fruit, or jam of any kind; when the latter
    is used, a little of it may be placed round the dish in small
    quantities, as a garnish.</p>

    <p><b>Bread and Butter Pudding..</b>&mdash;Butter a dish well,
    lay in a few slices of bread and butter, boil one pint of milk,
    pour out over two eggs well beaten, and then over the bread and
    butter, bake over half hour.</p>

    <p><b>Simple Bread Pudding.</b>&mdash;Take the crumbs of a
    stale roll, pour over it one pint of boiling milk, and set it
    by to cool. When quite cold, beat it up very fine with two
    ounces of butter, sifted sugar sufficient to sweeten it; grate
    in Haifa nutmeg, and add a pound of well-washed currants, beat
    up four eggs separately, and then mix them up with the rest,
    adding, if desired, a few strips of candied orange peel. All
    the ingredients must be beaten up together for about half an
    hour, as the lightness of the pudding depends upon that. Tie it
    up in a cloth, and boil for an hour. When it is dished, pour a
    little white wine sauce over the top.</p>

    <p><b>Christmas Plum Pudding.</b>&mdash;Suet, chopped small,

    of the ingredients. Dip a fine, close, linen cloth into boiling
    water, and put in a sieve (hair), flour it a little, and tie up
    close. Put the pudding into a saucepan containing six quarts of
    boiling water; keep a kettle of boiling water alongside, and
    fill up as it wastes. Be sure to keep it boiling at least six
    hours. Serve with any sauce; or arrow-root with brandy.</p>

    oz. of mixed spice, a teaspoonful of grated ginger, 1/2 lb. of
    bread crumbs, 1/2 lb. of flour, 1 pint of milk, and a wine
    glassful of brandy. Beat first the eggs, add half the milk,
    beat all together, and gradually stir in all the milk, then the
    suet, fruit, etc., and as much milk to mix it very thick. Boil
    in a cloth six or seven hours.</p>

    <p><b>Cottage Pudding.</b>&mdash;One pint sifted flour, three
    tablespoons melted butter, 2 eggs, one cup sweet milk, two
    teaspoonfuls cream tartar, one teaspoon soda, mix and bake.</p>

    <p><b>Cream Pudding.</b>&mdash;Cream, 1 pint; the yolks of
    seven eggs, seven tablespoonfuls of flour, 2 tablespoonfuls of
    sugar, salt, and a small bit of soda. Rub the cream with the
    eggs and flour; add the rest, the milk last, just before
    baking, and pour the whole into the pudding dish. Serve with
    sauce of wine, sugar, butter, flavored as you like.</p>

    <p><b>Crumb Pudding.</b>&mdash;The yolks and whites of three
    eggs, beaten separately, one ounce moist sugar, and sufficient
    bread crumbs to make it into a thick but not stiff mixture; a
    little powdered cinnamon. Beat all together for five minutes,
    and bake in a buttered tin. When baked, turn it out of the tin,
    pour two glasses of boiling wine over it, and serve. Cherries,
    either fresh or preserved, are very nice mixed in the
    pudding.</p>

    <p><b>Damson Pudding.</b>&mdash;Four or five tablespoonfuls of
    flour, three eggs beaten, a pint of milk, made into batter.
    Stone 1-1/2 lbs., of damsons, put them and 6 ozs. of sugar into
    the batter, and boil in a buttered basin for one hour and a
    half.</p>

    <p><b>Egg Pudding.</b>&mdash;It is made chiefly of eggs. It is
    nice made thus:&mdash;Beat well seven eggs; mix well with 2
    ozs. of flour, pint and a half of milk, a little salt; flavor
    with nutmeg, lemon juice, and orange-flour water. Boil 1-1/4
    hours in a floured cloth. Serve with wine sauce sweetened.</p>

    <p><b>Excellent Family Plum Pudding.</b>&mdash;Grate
    three-quarters of a pound of a stale loaf, leaving out the
    crusts; chop very fine three-quarters of a pound of firm beef
    suet (if you wish your pudding less rich, half a pound will
    do); mix well together with a quarter of a pound of flour; then
    add a pound of currants, well washed and well dried; half a
    pound of raisins, stoned, and the peel of a lemon, very finely
    shred and cut; four ounces of candied peel, either
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"
       id="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span> lemon, orange or citron, or
       all mingled (do not cut your peel too small or its flavor is
       lost); six ounces of sugar, a small teaspoonful of salt,
       three eggs, well beaten; mix all thoroughly together with as
       much milk as suffices to bring the pudding to a proper
       consistency, grate in a small nutmeg, and again stir the
       mixture vigorously. If you choose, add a small glass of
       brandy. Butter your mold or basin, which you must be sure to
       fill quite full, or the water will get in and spoil your
       handiwork; have your pudding cloth scrupulously clean and
       sweet, and of a proper thickness; tie down securely, and
       boil for seven or even eight hours.</p>

    <p><b>Extra Pudding.</b>&mdash;Cut light bread into thin
    slices. Form into the shape of a pudding in a dish. Then add a

    previously dusted the same with a coating of rice flour. Boil
    twenty-five minutes.</p>

    <p><b>Fig Pudding.</b>&mdash;Procure one pound of good figs,
    and chop them very fine, and also a quarter of a pound of suet,
    likewise chopped as fine as possible; dust them both with a
    little flour as you proceed&mdash;it helps to bind the pudding
    together; then take one pound of fine bread crumbs, and not
    quite a quarter of a pound of sugar; beat two eggs in a
    teacupful of milk, and mix all well together. Boil four hours.
    If you choose, serve it with wine or brandy sauce, and ornament
    your pudding with blanched almonds. Simply cooked, however, it
    is better where there are children, with whom it is generally a
    favorite. We forgot to say, flavor with a little allspice or
    nutmeg, as you like; but add the spice before the milk and
    eggs.</p>

    <p>It is very good without spice, and eaten with salt and
    butter.</p>

    <p>ANOTHER.&mdash;Put into a very deep pan half a pound of rice
    washed and picked; two ounces of butter, four ounces of sugar,
    a few allspice pounded, and two quarts of milk. Less butter
    will do, or some suet. Bake in a slow oven.</p>

    <p><b>Rich Rice Pudding</b>&mdash;Boil 1/2 lb. of rice in
    water, with a bit of salt, till quite tender; drain it dry; mix
    it with the yolks and whites of four eggs, a quarter of a pint
    of cream, with 2 ozs. of fresh butter melted in the latter; 4
    ozs. of beef suet or marrow, or veal suet taken from a fillet
    of veal, finely shred, 3/4 lb. of currants, two spoonfuls of
    brandy, one of peach-water, or ratafia, nutmeg, and a grated

    1-1/4 lbs. flour, 2 eggs beaten separately, a little salt, and
    as little milk as will make it. Make it into two small balls.

    <h3>HOW TO PUT UP PICKLES<br />
    AND MAKE CATSUPS</h3>

    <p><b>How to Pickle Beet Roots.</b>&mdash;Beet roots are a very
    pretty garnish for made dishes, and are thus pickled. Boil the
    roots till they are tender, then take off the skins, cut them
    in slices, gimp them in the shape of wheels, or what form you
    please, and put them into a jar. Take as much vinegar as you
    think will cover them, and boil it with a a little mace, a race
    of ginger sliced, and a few slices of horseradish. Pour it hot
    upon your roots and tie them down.</p>

    <p><b>Chow-Chow.</b>&mdash;Two quarts of small white onions,
    two quarts of gherkins, two quarts of string beans, two small
    cauliflowers, half a dozen ripe, red peppers, one-half pound
    mustard seed, one-half pound whole pepper, one pound ground
    mustard, and, as there is nothing so adulterated as ground
    mustard, it's better to get it at the druggist's; twenty or
    thirty bay leaves (not bog leaves, as some one of the ladies
    facetiously remarked), and two quarts of good cider, or wine
    vinegar. Peel the onions, halve the cucumbers, string the
    beans, and cut in pieces the cauliflower. Put all in a wooden
    tray, and sprinkle well with salt. In the morning wash and
    drain thoroughly, and put all into the cold vinegar, except the
    red peppers. Let boil twenty
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"
       id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span> minutes slowly, frequently
       turning over. Have wax melted in a deepish dish, and, as you
       fill and cork, dip into the wax. The peppers you can put in
       to show to the best advantage. If you have over six jars
       full, it's good to put the rest in a jar and eat from it for
       every dinner. Some add a little turmeric for the yellow
       color.</p>

    <p><b>Corn, Green, Pickling.</b>&mdash;When the corn is a
    little past the tenderest roasting ear state, pull it, take off
    one thickness of the husk, tie the rest of the husk down at the
    silk end loosely, place the ears in a clean cask compactly
    together, and put on a brine to cover them of about two-thirds
    the strength of meat pickle. When ready to use in winter, soak
    in cold water over night, and if this does not appear
    sufficient, change the water and freshen still more. Corn,
    prepared in this way, is excellent, very much resembling fresh
    corn from the stalk.</p>

    <p><b>Indian Pickle.</b>&mdash;One gallon of the best vinegar,
    quarter of a pound of bruised ginger, quarter of a pound of
    shalots, quarter of a pound of flour of mustard, quarter of a
    pound of salt, two ounces of mustard seed, two ounces of
    turmeric, one ounce of black pepper, ground fine, one ounce of
    cayenne. Mix all together, and put in cauliflower sprigs,
    radish pods, French beans, white cabbage, cucumber, onions, or
    any other vegetable; stir it well two or three days after any
    fresh vegetable is added, and wipe the vegetable with a dry
    cloth. The vinegar should not be boiled.</p>

    <p><b>How to Pickle Mushrooms.</b>&mdash;Buttons must be rubbed
    with a bit of flannel and salt; and from the larger take out
    the <i>red</i> inside, for when they are black they will not
    do, being too old. Throw a little salt over, and put them into
    a stewpan with some mace and pepper; as the liquor comes out,
    shake them well, and keep them over a gentle fire till all of
    it be dried into them again; then put as much vinegar into the
    pan as will cover them, give it one warm, and turn all into a
    glass or stone jar. They will keep two years, and are
    delicious.</p>

    <p><b>Pickle Sauce.</b>&mdash;Slice green tomatoes, onions,
    cabbage, cucumbers, and green peppers. Let all stand covered
    with salt over night. Wash, drain and chop fine. Be careful to
    keep as dry as possible. To two quarts of the hash, add four
    tablespoons of American mustard seed and two of English; two
    tablespoonfuls ground allspice, one of ground cloves, two
    teaspoonfuls of ground black pepper, one teaspoonful of celery
    seed. Cover with sharp vinegar, and boil slowly an hour. Put
    away in stone jar, and eat when wanted.</p>

    <p><b>Pickled Eggs.</b>&mdash;At the season of the year when
    eggs are plentiful, boil some four or six dozen in a capacious
    saucepan, until they become quite hard. Then, after carefully
    removing the shells, lay them in large-mouthed jars, and pour
    over them scalding vinegar, well seasoned with whole pepper,
    allspice, a few races of ginger, and a few cloves or garlic.
    When cold, bung down closely, and in a month they are fit for
    use. Where eggs are plentiful, the above pickle is by no means
    expensive, and is a relishing accompaniment to cold meat.</p>

    <p><b>How to Pickle Red Cabbage.</b>&mdash;Slice it into a
    colander, and sprinkle each layer with salt; let it drain two
    days, then put it into a jar, with boiling vinegar enough to
    cover it, and put in a few slices of beet-root. Observe to
    choose the purple red-cabbage. Those who like the flavor of
    spice will boil some pepper-corns, mustard-seed, or other
    spice, <i>whole</i>, with the vinegar. Califlower in branches,
    and thrown in after being salted, will color a beautiful
    red.</p>

    <p>ANOTHER.&mdash;Choose a sound large cabbage; shred it
    finely, and sprinkle it with salt, and let it stand in a dish a
    day and night. Then boil vinegar (from a pint) with ginger,
    cloves, and cayenne popper. Put the cabbage into jars, and pour
    the liquor upon it when cold.</p>

    <p><b>Spiced Tomatoes.</b>&mdash;Eight pounds tomatoes, four
    pounds of sugar, one quart vinegar, one tablespoon each of
    cloves, cinnamon and allspice, make a syrup of the sugar and
    vinegar. Tie the spice in a bag and put, in syrup, take the
    skins off the tomatoes, and put them in the syrup, when scalded
    through skim them out and cook away one-half, leave the spices
    in, then put in your tomatoes again and boil until the syrup is
    thick.</p>

    <p><b>Tomato Lilly.</b>&mdash;Prepare one peck of green
    tomatoes by slicing and laying them in a jar over night, with a
    little salt, than chop them and cook in water until you think
    them sufficiently tender then take them up in a colander and
    drain nicely, then take two large cabbages, chop and cook same
    as tomatoes, then chop six green peppers and add one quart
    vinegar, put all in kettle together and boil a short time; add
    fresh vinegar and spice with one ounce each cinnamon and
    cloves, one pound sugar and half pint molasses. Onions can be
    used instead of cabbage if preferred.</p>

    <p><b>How to Pickle Walnuts.</b>&mdash;When a pin will go into
    them, put a brine of salt and water boiled, and strong enough
    to bear an egg, being quite cold first. Let them soak six days;
    then change the brine, let them stand six more; then drain, and
    pour over them in a jar a pickle of the best vinegar, with
    plenty of pepper, pimento, ginger, mace, cloves, mustard-seed
    and horseradish; all boiled together, but cold. To every
    hundred of walnuts put six spoonfuls of mustard-seed, and two
    or three heads of garlic or shalot, but the latter is least
    strong. In this way they will be good for several years, if
    closely covered. They will not be fit to eat under six months.
    This pickle makes good ketchup.</p>

    <p><b>A Good Ketchup.</b>&mdash;Boil one bushel of tomatoes
    until soft enough to rub through a sieve. Then add to the
    liquid a half gallon of vinegar, 1-1/2 pints salt, 2 ounces of
    cloves, 1/4 pound allspice, 3 ounces good cayenne pepper, five
    heads of garlic, skinned and separated, 1 pound of sugar. Boil
    slowly until reduced to one-half. It takes about one day. Set
    away for a week, boil over once, and, if too thick, thin with
    vinegar; bottle and seal as for chow-chow.</p>

    <p><b>How to Keep Ketchup Twenty Years.</b>&mdash;Take a gallon
    of strong stale beer, 1 lb. of anchovies, washed from the
    pickle; 1 lb. of shalots, 1/2 oz. of mace, 1/2 oz. of cloves,
    1/4 oz. whole pepper, 1/2 oz. of ginger, 2 quarts of large
    mushroom flaps, rubbed to pieces; cover all close, and simmer
    till it is half wasted, strain, cool, then bottle. A spoonful
    of this ketchup is sufficient for a pint of melted butter.</p>

    <p><b>Mushroom Ketchup.</b>&mdash;Sprinkle mushroom flaps,
    gathered in September, with common salt, stir them occasionally
    for two or three days; then lightly squeeze out the juice, and
    add to each gallon bruised cloves and mustard seed, of each,
    half an ounce; bruised allspice, black pepper, and ginger, of
    each, one ounce; gently heat to the boiling point in a covered
    vessel, macerate for fourteen days, and strain; should it
    exhibit any indication of change in a few weeks, bring it again
    to the boiling point, with a little more spice.</p>

    <p><b>Oyster Ketchup:</b>&mdash;Beard the oysters; boil them up
    in their liquor; strain, and pound them in a mortar; boil the
    beards in spring water, and strain it to the first oyster
    liquor; boil the pounded oysters in the mixed liquors, with
    beaten mace and pepper. Some add a very little mushroom
    ketchup, vinegar, or lemon-juice; but the less the natural
    flavor is overpowered the better; only spice is necessary for
    its preservation. This oyster ketchup will
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page121"
       id="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span> keep perfectly good longer
       than oysters are ever out of season.</p>

    <p><b>Tomato Ketchup.</b>&mdash;Put them over the fire crushing
    each one as you drop it into the pot; let them boil five
    minutes; take them off, strain through a colander, and then
    through a sieve, get them over the fire again as soon as
    possible, and boil down two-thirds, when boiled down add to
    every gallon of this liquid one ounce of cayenne pepper, one
    ounce of black pepper, one pint vinegar, four ounces each of
    cinnamon and mace, two spoonfuls salt.</p>

    <p><b>Very Fine Walnut Ketchup.</b>&mdash;Boil a gallon of the
    expressed juice of green tender walnuts, and skim it well; then
    put in 2 lbs. of anchovies, bones and liquor, 2 lbs. shalots, 1
    oz. each of cloves, mace, pepper, and one clove of garlic. Let
    all simmer till the shalots sink; then put the liquor into a
    pan till cold; bottle and divide the spice to each. Cork
    closely, and tie a bladder over. It will keep twenty years, but
    is not good the first. Be very careful to express the juice at
    home; for it is rarely unadulterated, if bought.</p>

    <h3>HOW TO ROAST, BOIL, OR BROIL<br />
    POULTRY</h3>

    <p><b>How to Roast Chickens.</b>&mdash;Pluck carefully, draw
    and truss them, and put them to a good fire; singe, dust, and
    baste them with butter. Cover the breast with a sheet of
    buttered paper; remove it ten minutes before it is enough; that
    it may brown. A chicken will take 15 to 20 minutes. Serve with
    butter and parsley.</p>

    <p><b>How to Boil Chickens.</b>&mdash;Fasten the wings and legs
    to the body by threads tied round. Steep them in skim milk two
    hours. Then put them in cold water, and boil over a slow fire.
    Skim clean. Serve with white sauce or melted butter sauce, or
    parsley and butter.&mdash;Or melt 1 oz. of butter in a cupful
    of milk; add to it the yolk of an egg beat up with a little
    flour and cream; heat over the fire, stirring well.</p>

    <p><b>Geese (a la mode).</b>&mdash;Skin and bone the goose;
    boil and peel a dried tongue, also a fowl; season with pepper,
    salt and mace, and then roll it round the tongue; season the
    goose in the same way, and lay the fowl and tongue on the
    goose, with slices of ham between them. Beef marrow rolled
    between the fowl and the goose, will greatly enrich it. Put it
    all together in a pan, with two quarts of beef gravy, the bones
    of the goose and fowl, sweet herbs and onion; cover close, and
    stew an hour slowly; take up the goose; skim off the fat,
    strain, and put in a glassful of good port wine, two
    tablespoonfuls of ketchup, a veal sweetbread cut small, some
    mushrooms, a piece of butter rolled in flour, pepper and salt;
    stew the goose half an hour longer; take up and pour the ragout
    over it. Garnish with lemon.</p>

    <p><b>How to Roast Pigeons.</b>&mdash;Take a little pepper and
    salt, a piece of butter, and parsley cut small; mix and put the
    mixture into the bellies of the pigeons, tying the necks tight;
    take another string; fasten one end of it to their legs and
    rumps, and the other to a hanging spit, basting them with
    butter; when done, lay them in a dish, and they will swim with
    gravy.</p>

    <p><b>How to Boil Pigeons.</b>&mdash;Wash clean; chop some
    parsley small; mix it with crumbs of bread, pepper, salt and a
    bit of butter; stuff the pigeons, and boil 15 minutes in some
    mutton broth or gravy. Boil some rice soft in milk; when it
    begins to thicken, beat the yolks of two or three eggs, with
    two or three spoonfuls of cream, and a little nutmeg; mix well
    with a bit of butter rolled in flour.</p>

    <p><b>How to Broil Pigeons.</b>&mdash;After cleaning, split the
    backs, pepper and salt them, and broil them very nicely; pour
    over them either stewed or pickled mushrooms, in melted butter,
    and serve as hot as possible.</p>

    <p><b>Scalloped Cold Chickens..</b>&mdash;Mince the meat very
    small, and set it over the fire, with a scrape of nutmeg, a
    little pepper and salt, and a little cream, for a few minutes,
    put it into the scallop shells, and fill them with crumbs of
    bread, over which put some bits of butter, and brown them
    before the fire. Veal and ham eat well done the same way, and
    lightly covered with crumbs of bread, or they may be put on in
    little heaps.</p>

    <p><b>How to Roast Turkey.</b>&mdash;The sinews of the legs
    should be drawn whichever way it is dressed. The head should be
    twisted under the wing; and in drawing it, take care not to
    tear the liver, nor let the gall touch it.</p>

    <p>Put a stuffing of sausage-meat; or, if sausages are to be
    served in a dish a bread stuffing. As this makes a large
    addition to the size of the bird, observe that the heat of the
    fire is constantly to that part; for the breast is often not
    done enough. A little strip of paper should be put on the bone
    to hinder it from scorching while the other parts roast. Baste
    well and froth it up. Serve with gravy in the dish, and plenty
    of bread-sauce in a sauce-tureen. Add a few crumbs, and a
    beaten egg to the stuffing of sausage-meat.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>SAUCES FOR MEATS, FISH, E<sup><u>TC.</u></sup></h3>

    <p><b>Anchovy Sauce.</b>&mdash;Chop one or two anchovies,
    without washing, put to them some flour and butter, and a
    little water; stir it over the fire till it boils once or
    twice. If the anchovies are good, they will dissolve.</p>

    <p><b>Essence Of Anchovies.</b>&mdash;Take two dozen of
    anchovies, chop them, and without the bone, but with some of
    their liquor strained, add to them sixteen large spoonfuls of
    water; boil gently till dissolved, which will be in a few
    minutes&mdash;when cold, strain and bottle it.</p>

    <p><b>Apple Sauce.</b>&mdash;Pare, core, and quarter half a
    dozen good sized apples, and throw them into cold water to
    preserve their whiteness. Boil them in a saucepan till they are
    soft enough to mash&mdash;it is impossible to specify any
    particular time, as some apples cook much more speedily than
    others. When done, bruise them to a pulp, put in a piece of
    butter as large as a nutmeg, and sweeten them to taste. Put
    into saucepan only sufficient water to prevent them burning.
    Some persons put the apples in a stone jar placed in boiling
    water; there is then no danger of their catching.</p>

    <p><b>Apple Sauce for Goose or Roast Pork.</b>&mdash;Pare,
    core, and slice some apples, and put them in a strong jar, into
    a pan of water. When sufficiently boiled, bruise to a pulp,
    adding a little butter, and a little brown sugar.</p>

    <p><b>A Substitute for Cream.</b>&mdash;Beat up the whole of a
    fresh egg in a basin, and then pour boiling tea over it
    gradually to prevent its curdling; it is difficult from the
    taste, to distinguish it from rich cream.</p>

    <p><b>Bechamel Sauce.</b>&mdash;Put a few slices of ham into a
    stew-pan, a few mushrooms, two or three shalots, two cloves,
    also a bay leaf and a bit of butter. Let them stand a few
    hours. Add a little water, flour and milk or cream; simmer
    forty minutes. Scalded parsley, very fine may be added.</p>

    <p><b>Bread Sauce.</b>&mdash;Break three-quarters of a pound of
    stale bread into small pieces, carefully excluding any
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"
       id="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span> crusty and outside bits,
       having previously simmered till quite tender, an onion, well
       peeled and quartered in a pint of milk. Put the crumbs into
       a very clean saucepan, and, if you like the flavor, a small
       teaspoonful of sliced onion, chopped, or rather minced, as
       finely as possible. Pour over the milk, taking away the
       onion simmered in it, cover it up, and let it stand for an
       hour to soak. Then, with a fork, beat it quite smooth, and
       seasoned with a very little powdered mace, cayenne and salt
       to taste, adding one ounce of butter; give the whole a boil,
       stirring all the time, and it is ready to serve. A small
       quantity of cream added at the last moment, makes the sauce
       richer and smoother. Common white pepper may take the place
       of cayenne, a few peppercorns may be simmered in the milk,
       but they should be extracted before sending to table.</p>

    <p><b>Bread Sauce.</b>&mdash;Grate some old bread into a basin;
    pour boiling new milk over it; add an onion with five cloves
    stuck in it, with pepper and salt to taste. Cover it and simmer
    in a slow oven. When enough, take out the onion and cloves;
    beat it well, and add a little melted butter. The addition of
    cream very much improves this sauce.</p>

    <p><b>Caper Sauce.</b>&mdash;Melt some butter, chop the capers
    fine, boil them with the butter. An ounce of capers will be
    sufficient for a moderate size sauce-boat. Add, if you like, a
    little chopped parsley, and a little vinegar. More vinegar, a
    little cayenne, and essence of anchovy, make it suitable for
    fish.</p>

    <p>As a substitute for capers, some use chopped pickled
    gherkins.</p>

    <p><b>Essence Of Celery.</b>&mdash;Soak the seeds in spirits of
    wine or brandy; or infuse the root in the same for 24 hours,
    then take out, squeezing out all the liquor, and infuse more
    root in the same liquor to make it stronger. A few drops will
    <ins class="correction"
    title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'flvor'.">
    flavor</ins> broth, soup, etc.</p>

    <p><b>Celery Sauce.</b>&mdash;Wash well the inside leaves of
    three heads of celery; cut them into slices quarter inch thick,
    boil for six minutes, and drain; take a tablespoonful of flour,
    two ounces of butter, and a teacupful of cream; beat well, and
    when warm, put in the celery and stir well over the fire about
    twelve minutes. The sauce is very <ins class="correction"
     title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'goood'.">good</ins>
     for boiled fowl, etc.</p>

    <p><b>Cocoa Sauce.</b>&mdash;Scrape a portion of the kernel of
    a Cocoa nut, adding the juice of three lemons, a teaspoonful of
    the tincture of cayenne pepper, a teaspoonful of shallot
    vinegar, and half a cupful of water. Gently simmer for a few
    hours.</p>

    <p><b>Egg Sauce.</b>&mdash;Boil two eggs hard, half chop the
    whites, put in the yolks, chop them together, but not very
    fine, put them with 1/4 lb. of good melted butter.</p>

    <p><b>Egg Sauce.</b>&mdash;Four eggs boiled twelve minutes,
    then lay them in fresh water, cold, pull off the shells, chop
    whites and yolks separately, mix them lightly, half pint melted
    butter, made in proportion of quarter pound of butter, to a
    large tablespoon flour, four of milk and hot water, add
    powdered mace or nutmeg, to be eaten with pork, boiled, or
    poultry, use chicken gravy or the water the chicken were boiled
    in.</p>

    <p><b>Horseradish Sauce.</b>&mdash;Perhaps a good receipt for
    horseradish sauce, which is so excellent with both hot and cold
    beef, but which we do not always see served up with either. Two
    tablespoonfuls of mustard, the same of vinegar, three
    tablespoonfuls of cream or milk and one of pounded white sugar,
    well beaten up together with a small quantity of grated
    horseradish. This is, of course, to be served up cold.</p>

    <p><b>Mint Sauce.</b>&mdash;Pick, mash and chop fine green
    spearmint, to two tablespoons of the minced leaves, put eight
    of vinegar, adding a little sugar. Serve cold.</p>

    <p><b>Mint Sauce.</b>&mdash;Wash fresh gathered mint; pick the
    leaves from the stalks; mince them very fine, and put them into
    a sauce-boat with a teaspoonful of sugar and four
    tablespoonfuls of vinegar. It may also be made with dried mint
    or with mint vinegar.</p>

    <p><b>Onion Sauce.</b>&mdash;Peel the onions, and boil them
    tender; squeeze the water from them, then chop them, and add to
    them butter that has been melted, rich and smooth, as will be
    hereafter directed, but with a little good milk instead of
    water; boil it up once, and serve it for boiled rabbits,
    partridge, scrag, or knuckle of veal, or roast mutton. A turnip
    boiled with the onions makes them milder.</p>

    <p><b>Quin's Fish Sauce.</b>&mdash;Half a pint of mushroom
    pickle, the same of walnut, six long anchovies pounded, six
    cloves of garlic, three of them pounded; half a spoonful of
    cayenne pepper; put them into a bottle, and shake well before
    using. It is also good with beefsteaks.</p>

    <p><b>Sauce for Cold Partridges, Moor-Game,
    Etc.</b>&mdash;Pound four anchovies and two cloves of garlic in
    a mortar; add oil and vinegar to the taste. Mince the meat, and
    put the sauce to it as wanted.</p>

    <p><b>Sauce for Ducks.</b>&mdash;Serve a rich gravy in the
    dish; cut the breast into slices, but don't take them off; cut
    a lemon, and put pepper and salt on it, then squeeze it on the
    breast, and pour a spoonful of gravy over before you help.</p>

    <p><b>Sauce for Fowl of any Sort.</b>&mdash;Boil some veal
    gravy, pepper, salt, the juice of a Seville orange and a lemon,
    and a quarter as much of port wine as of gravy; pour it into
    the dish or a boat.</p>

    <p><b>Sauce for Hot or Cold Roast Beef.</b>&mdash;Grate, or
    scrape very fine, some horseradish, a little made mustard, some
    pounded white sugar and four large spoonfuls of vinegar. Serve
    in a saucer.</p>

    <p><b>Sauce for Salmon.</b>&mdash;Boil a bunch of fennel and
    parsley chop them small, and put into it some good melted
    butter. Gravy sauce should be served with it; put a little
    brown gravy into a saucepan, with one anchovy, a teaspoonful of
    lemon pickle, a tablespoonful of walnut pickle, two spoonfuls
    of water in which the fish was boiled, a stick of horseradish,
    a little browning, and salt; boil them four minutes; thicken
    with flour and a good lump of butter, and strain through a hair
    sieve.</p>

    <p><b>Sauce for Savoury Pies.</b>&mdash;Take some gravy, one
    anchovy, a sprig of sweet herbs, an onion, and a little
    mushroom liquor; boil it a little, and thicken it with burnt
    butter, or a bit of butter rolled in flour; add a little port
    wine, and open the pie, and put it in. It will serve for lamb,
    mutton, veal or beef pies.</p>

    <p><b>Sauce for a Turkey.</b>&mdash;Open some oysters into a
    basin, and wash them in their own liquor, and as soon as
    settled pour into a saucepan; add a little white gravy, a
    teaspoonful of lemon pickle; thicken with flour and butter;
    boil it three or four minutes; add a spoonful of thick cream,
    and then the oysters; shake them over the fire till they are
    hot, but do not let them boil.</p>

    <p><b>Sauce for Wild Fowl.</b>&mdash;Simmer a teacupful of port
    wine, the same quantity of good meat gravy, a little shalot, a
    little pepper, salt, a grate of nutmeg and a bit of mace, for
    ten minutes; put in a bit of butter and flour, give it all one
    boil, and pour it through the birds. In general they are not
    stuffed as tame, but may be done so if liked.</p>

    <p><b>French Tomato Sauce.</b>&mdash;Cut ten or a dozen
    tomatoes into quarters, and put them into a saucepan, with four
    onions, sliced, a little parsley, thyme, a clove, and a quarter
    of a pound of butter; then set the saucepan on the fire,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"
       id="page123"></a>[pg 123]</span> stirring occasionally for
       three-quarters of an hour; strain the sauce through a
       horse-hair sieve, and serve with the directed articles.</p>

    <p><b>Tomato Sauce.</b>&mdash;Take 12 tomatoes, very red and
    ripe; take off the stalks, take out the seeds, and press out
    the water. Put the expressed tomatoes into a stewpan, with
    1-1/2 ozs. of butter, a bay leaf, and a little thyme; put it
    upon a moderate fire, stir it into a pulp; put into it a good
    cullis, or the top of broth, which will be better. Rub it
    through a search, and put it into a stewpan with two spoonfuls
    of cullis; put in a little salt and cayenne.</p>

    <p>ANOTHER.&mdash;Proceed as above with the seeds and water.
    Put them into a stewpan, with salt and cayenne, and three
    tablespoonfuls of beef gravy. Set them on a slow stove for an
    hour, or till properly melted. Strain, and add a little good
    stock; and simmer a few minutes.</p>

    <p><b>White Sauce.</b>&mdash;One pound of knuckle of veal, or
    any veal trimmings, or cold white meat, from which all brown
    skin has been removed; if meat has been cooked, more will be
    required. It is best to have a little butcher's meat fresh,
    even if you have plenty of cold meat in the larder; any chicken
    bones greatly improve the stock. This should simmer for five
    hours, together with a little salt, a dozen white peppercorns,
    one or two small onions stuck with cloves, according to taste,
    a slice or two of lean ham, and a little shred of celery and a
    carrot (if in season) in a quart of water. Strain it, and skim
    off all the fat; then mix one dessert-spoonful of flour in a
    half pint of cream; or, for economy's sake, half milk and half
    cream, or even all good new milk; add this to the stock, and if
    not salt enough, cautiously add more seasoning. Boil all
    together very gently for ten minutes, stirring all the time, as
    the sauce easily burns and very quickly spoils. This stock,
    made in large quantities, makes white soup; for this an old
    fowl, stewed down, is excellent, and the liquor in which a
    young turkey has been boiled is as good a foundation as can be
    desired.</p>

    <p><b>Economical White Sauce.</b>&mdash;Cut up fine one carrot,
    two small onions, and put them into a stewpan with two ounces
    of butter, and simmer till the butter is nearly absorbed. Then
    mix a small teacupful of flour in a pint of new milk, boil the
    whole quietly till it thickens, strain it, season with salt and
    white pepper or cayenne, and it is ready to serve. Or mix well
    two ounces of flour with one ounce of butter; with a little
    nutmeg, pepper and salt; add a pint of milk, and throw in a
    strip of lemon peel; stir well over the fire till quite thick,
    and strain.</p>

    <p><b>Wine Sauce.</b>&mdash;One and 1/2 cups sugar, three
    quarters cup of wine, a large spoonful flour, and a large piece
    of butter.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>HOW TO MAKE SOUPS<br />
    AND BROTHS</h3>

    <p><b>Artichoke Soup.</b>&mdash;Take Jerusalem artichokes
    according to the quantity of soup required to be made, cut them
    in slices, with a quarter of a pound of butter, two or three
    onions and turnips, sliced into a stewpan, and stew over a very
    slow fire till done enough, and thin it with good veal stock.
    Just before you serve, at the last boil, add a quarter of a
    pint of good cream. This is an excellent soup. Season to taste
    with a little salt and cayenne. As it is necessary to vary
    soups, we shall give you a few to choose from according to
    season and taste. All brown soups must be clear and thin, with
    the exception of mock turtle, which must be thickened with
    flour first browned with butter in a stewpan. If the flour is
    added without previous browning, it preserves a raw taste that
    by no means improves the flavor.</p>

    <p><b>Asparagus Soup.</b>&mdash;Three or four pounds of veal
    cut fine, a little salt pork, two or three bunches of asparagus
    and three quarts of water. Boil one-half of the asparagus with
    the meat, leaving the rest in water until about twenty minutes
    before serving; then add the rest of the asparagus and boil
    just before serving; add one pint of milk; thicken with a
    little flour, and season. The soup should boil about three
    hours before adding the last half of the asparagus.</p>

    <p><b>Beef Broth.</b>&mdash;Put two pounds of lean beef, one
    pound of scrag of veal, one pound of scrag of mutton, sweet
    herbs, and ten peppercorns, into a nice tin saucepan, with five
    quarts of water; simmer to three quarts, and clear from the fat
    when cold. Add one onion, if approved.</p>

    <p>Soup and broth made of different meats are more supporting,
    as well as better flavored.</p>

    <p>To remove the fat, take it off, when cold, as clean as
    possible; and if there be still any remaining, lay a bit of
    clean blotting or cap paper on the broth when in the basin, and
    it will take up every particle.</p>

    <p><b>Beef Soup.</b>&mdash;Cut all the lean off the shank, and
    with a little beef suet in the bottom of the kettle, fry it to
    a nice brown; put in the bones and cover with water; cover the
    kettle closely; let it cook slowly until the meat drops from
    the bones; strain through a colander and leave it in the dish
    during the night, which is the only way to get off all the fat.
    The day it is wanted for the table, fry as brown as possible a
    carrot, an onion, and a very small turnip sliced thin. Just
    before taking up, put in half a tablespoonful of sugar, a blade
    of mace, six cloves, a dozen kernels of allspice, a small
    tablespoonful of celery seed. With the vegetables this must
    cook slowly in the soup an hour; then strain again for the
    table. If you use vermicelli or pearl barley, soak in
    water.</p>

    <p><b>Dr. Liebig's Beef Tea.</b>&mdash;When one pound of lean
    beef, free from fat, and separated from the bones, in a
    finely-chopped state in which it is used for mince-meat, or
    beef-sausages, is uniformly mixed with its own weight of cold
    water, slowly heated till boiling, and the liquid, after
    boiling briskly for a minute or two, is strained through the
    towel from the coagulated albumen and the fibrine, now become
    hard and horny, we obtain an equal weight of the most aromatic
    soup, of such strength as cannot be obtained even by boiling
    for hours from a piece of flesh. When mixed with salt and the
    other additions by which soup is usually seasoned, and tinged
    somewhat darker by means of roasted onions, or burnt bread, it
    forms the very best soup which can, in any way, be prepared
    from one pound of flesh.</p>

    <p><b>Brown Gravy Soup.</b>&mdash;Shred a small plate of
    onions, put some dripping into a frying-pan and fry the onions
    till they are of a dark brown; then, having about three pounds
    of beef cut up in dice, without fat or bone, brown that in a
    frying-pan. Now get a sauce-pan to contain about a gallon, and
    put in the onions and meat, with a carrot and a turnip cut
    small, and a little celery, if you have it; if not, add two
    seeds of celery; put three quarts, or three and a half quarts
    of water to this, and stir all together with a little pepper
    and salt; simmer very slowly, and skim off what rises; in three
    or four hours the soup will be clear. When served, add a little
    vermicelli, which should have previously been boiled in water;
    the liquid should be carefully poured off through a sieve. A
    large quantity may be made in the same proportions. Of course,
    the meat and onions must be stirred whilst frying, and
    constantly turned; they should be of a fine brown, not black,
    and celery-seed will give a flavor, it is so strong.</p>

    <p><b>Carrot Soup.</b>&mdash;Put some beef bones, with four
    quarts of the liquor in which a leg of mutton or beef has been
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"
       id="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span> boiled, two large onions, a
       turnip, pepper and salt into a sauce-pan, and stew for three
       hours. Have ready six large carrots, scraped and cut thin,
       strain the soup on them, and stew them till soft enough to
       pulp through a hair sieve or coarse cloth, then boil the
       pulp with the soup, which is to be as thick as pea-soup. Use
       two wooden spoons to rub the carrots through. Make the soup
       the day before it is to be used. Add cayenne. Pulp only the
       red part of the carrot, and not the yellow.</p>

    <p><b>Clam Soup.</b>&mdash;Cut salt pork in very small squares
    and fry light brown; add one large or two small onions cut very
    fine, and cook about ten minutes; add two quarts water and one
    quart of raw potatoes, sliced; let it boil; then add one quart
    of clams. Mix one tablespoonful of flour with water, put it
    with one pint of milk, and pour into the soup, and let it boil
    about five minutes. Butter, pepper, salt. Worcestershire sauce
    to taste.</p>

    <p><ins class="correction"
         title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'Groutons'.">
    <b>Croutons.</b></ins>&mdash;These are simply pieces of bread
    fried brown and crisp, to be used in soups.</p>

    <p><b>Game Soups.</b>&mdash;Cut in pieces a partridge,
    pheasant, or rabbit; add slices of veal, ham, onions, carrots,
    etc. Add a little water, heat a little on slow fire, as gravy
    is done; then add some good broth, boil the meat gently till it
    is done. Strain, and stew in the liquor what herbs you
    please.</p>

    <p><b>Game Soup.</b>&mdash;In the season for game, it is easy
    to have good game soup at very little expense, and very nice.
    Take the meat from off the bones of any cold game left, pound
    it in a mortar and break up the bones, and pour on them a quart
    of any good broth, and boil for an hour and a half. Boil and
    mash six turnips, and mix with the pounded meat, and then pass
    them through a sieve. Strain the broth, and stir in the mixture
    of meat and turnips which has been strained through the sieve;
    keep the soup-pot near the fire, but do not let it boil. When
    ready to dish the soup for table, beat the yolks of five eggs
    very lightly, and mix with them half a pint of good cream. Set
    the soup on to boil, and, as it boils, stir in the beaten eggs
    and cream, but be careful that it does not boil after they are
    stirred in, as the egg will curdle. Serve hot.</p>

    <p><b>Julienne Soup.</b>&mdash;Put a piece of butter the size
    of an egg into the soup-kettle; stir until melted. Cut three
    young onions small; fry them a nice brown; add three quarts of
    good clear beef-stock, a little mace, pepper and salt; let it
    boil an hour; add three young carrots and three turnips cut
    small, a stalk of celery cut fine, a pint of French beans, a
    pint of green peas; let this boil two hours; if not a bright,
    clear color, add a spoonful of soy. This is a nice summer
    soup.</p>

    <p><b>Lobster Soup.</b>&mdash;One large lobster or two small
    ones; pick all the meat from the shell and chop fine; scald one
    quart of milk and one pint of water, then add the lobster, one
    pound of butter, a teaspoonful of flour, and salt and red
    pepper to taste. Boil ten minutes and serve hot.</p>

    <p><b>Mock Turtle Soup.</b>&mdash;One soup-bone, one quart of
    turtle beans, one large spoonful of powdered cloves, salt and
    pepper. Soak the beans over night, put them on with the
    soup-bone in nearly six quarts of water, and cook five or six
    hours. When half done, add the cloves, salt and pepper; when
    done, strain through a colander, pressing the pulp of the beans
    through to make the soup the desired thickness, and serve with
    a few slices of hard-boiled egg and lemon sliced very thin. The
    turtle beans are black and can only be obtained from large
    groce.</p>

    <p><b>Oyster Soup.</b>&mdash;Take one quart of water, one
    teacup of butter, one pint of milk, two teaspoons of salt, four
    crackers rolled fine, and one teaspoon of pepper; bring to full
    boiling heat as soon as possible, then add one quart of
    oysters; let the whole come to boiling heat quickly and remove
    from the fire.</p>

    <p><b>Oyster Soup.</b>&mdash;Pour one quart of boiling water
    into a skillet; then one quart of good rich milk; stir in one
    teacup of rolled cracker crumbs; season with pepper and salt to
    taste. When all come to boil, add one quart of good fresh
    oysters; stir well, so as to keep from scorching; then add a
    piece of good sweet butter about the size of an egg; let it
    boil up once, then remove from the fire immediately; dish up
    and send to table.</p>

    <p><b>Ox Tail Soup.</b>&mdash;Take two ox tails and two whole
    onions, two carrots, a small turnip, two tablespoonfuls of
    flour, and a little white pepper; add a gallon of water, let
    all boil for two hours; then take out the tails and cut the
    meat into small pieces, return the bones to the pot for a short
    time, boil for another hour, then strain the soup, and rinse
    two spoonfuls of arrow-root to add to it with the meat cut from
    the bones, and let all boil for a quarter of an hour.</p>

    <p><b>Scotch Broth.</b>&mdash;Take one-half teacup barley, four
    quarts cold water; bring this to the boil and skim; now put in
    a neck of mutton and boil again for half an hour, skim well the
    sides of the pot also; have ready two carrots, one large onion,
    a small head of cabbage, one bunch parsley, one sprig of celery
    top; chop all these fine, add your chopped vegetables, pepper
    and salt to taste. This soup takes two hours to cook.</p>

    <p><b>Soup and Bouille.</b>&mdash;Stew a brisket of beef with
    some turnips, celery, leeks and onions, all finely cut. Put the
    pieces of beef into the pot first, then the roots, and half a
    pint of beef gravy, with a few cloves. Simmer for an hour. Add
    more beef gravy, and boil gently for half an hour.</p>

    <p><b>Royal Soup.</b>&mdash;Take a scrag or knuckle of veal,
    slices of undressed gammon of bacon, onions, mace, and a small
    quantity of water; simmer till very strong, and lower it with a
    good beef broth made the day before, and stewed till the meat
    is done to rags. Add cream, vermicelli, almonds and a roll.</p>

    <p><b>Various Soups.</b>&mdash;Good soups may be made from
    fried meats, where the fat and gravy are added to the boiled
    barley; and for that purpose, fat beef steaks, pork steaks,
    mutton chops, etc. should be preferred, as containing more of
    the nutritious principle. When nearly done frying, add a little
    water, which will produce a gravy to be added to the barley
    broth; a little wheat flour should be dredged in also; a
    quantity of onions, cut small, should also be fried with the
    fat, which gives the soup a fine flavor, assisted by seasoning,
    etc.</p>

    <p>Soups may be made from broiled meats. While the fat beef
    steak is doing before the fire, or mutton chop, etc., save the
    drippings on a dish, in which a little flour, oatmeal, with cut
    onions, etc., are put.</p>

    <p><b>Grand Consomme Soup.</b>&mdash;Put into a pot two
    knuckles of veal, a piece of a leg of beef, a fowl, or an old
    cock, a rabbit, or two old partridges; add a ladleful of soup,
    and stir it well; when it comes to a jelly, put in a sufficient
    quantity of stock, and see that it is clear; let it boil,
    skimming and refreshing it with water; season it as the above;
    you may add, if you like, a clove of garlic; let it then boil
    slowly or simmer four or five hours; put it through a towel,
    and use it for mixing in sauces or clear soups.</p>

    <p><b>Julienne Soup.</b>&mdash;Take some carrots and turnips,
    and turn them riband-like; a few heads of celery, some leeks
    and onions, and cut them in lozenges, boil them till they are
    cooked, then put them into clear gravy soup. Brown
    thickening.&mdash;N.B. You may, in summer time, add green peas,
    asparagus tops, French beans, some lettuce or
    sorrel.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"

    <p><b>Soup and Soups.</b>&mdash;It is not at all necessary to
    keep a special fire for five hours every day in order to have
    at dinner a first course of soup. Nor need a good, savory,
    nutritious soup for a family of five cost more than 10 cents.
    There is no use hurling any remarks about "swill-pails." Every
    housekeeper who knows anything of her kitchen and dining-room
    affairs, knows there are usually nice clean fragments of roasts
    and broils left over, and that broth in which lamb, mutton,
    beef, and fowls have been boiled is in existence, and that
    twice a week or so there is a bowl of drippings from roasted
    meats. All these when simmered with rice, macaroni, or
    well-chosen vegetables, and judiciously seasoned, make good
    soups, and can be had without a special fire, and without
    sending to the butcher's for special meats. We name a few of
    the soups we make, and beg leave to add that they are pretty
    well received. We make them in small quantities, for nobody
    with three additional courses before him wants to eat a
    <i>quart</i> of soup, you know!</p>

    <p>1.&mdash;One pint of good gravy, three cups boiling water, a
    slice of turnip, and half an onion cut in small bits, two
    grated crackers. Simmer half an hour.</p>

    <p>2.&mdash;On ironing day cut off the narrow ends from two or
    three sirloin steaks, chop them into morsels and put in a
    stewpan with a little salt, a tablespoonful of rice and a pint
    of cold water, and simmer slowly for three hours. Then add
    water enough to make a quart of soup, a tablespoonful of tomato
    catsup, and a little browned flour mixed with the yolk of an
    egg.</p>

    <p>3.&mdash;Pare and slice very thin four good sized potatoes,
    pour over them two cups of boiling water, and simmer gently
    until the potatoes are dissolved. Add salt, a lump of nice
    butter, and a pint of sweet milk with a dust of pepper. Let it
    boil up once, and serve. You wouldn't think it, but it is real
    good, and children cry for it.</p>

    <p>4.&mdash;One pint meat broth, one pint boiling water, slice
    in an onion, or a parsnip, or half a turnip&mdash;or all three
    if liked&mdash;boil until the vegetables are soft, add a little
    salt if needed, and a tablespoonful of Halford sauce.</p>

    <p>5.&mdash;Let green corn, in the time of green corn, be
    grated, and to a pint of it put a pint of rich milk, a pint of
    water, a little butter, salt and pepper. Boil gently for
    fifteen or twenty minutes.</p>

    <p><b>Split Pea Soup.</b>&mdash;Take beef bones or any cold
    meats, and two pounds of corned pork; pour on them a gallon of
    hot water, and let them simmer three hours, removing all the
    scum. Boil one quart of split peas two hours, having been
    previously soaked, as they require much cooking: strain off the
    meat and mash the peas into the soup; season with black pepper,
    and let it simmer one hour; fry two or three slices of bread a
    nice brown, cut into slices and put into the bottom of the
    tureen, and on them pour the soup.</p>

    <p><b>Tomato Soup.</b>&mdash;Boil chicken or beef four hours;
    then strain; add to the soup one can of tomatoes and boil one
    hour. This will make four quarts of soup.</p>

    <p><b>Tomato Soup without Meat.</b>&mdash;One quart of
    tomatoes, one quart of water, one quart of milk. Butter, salt
    and pepper to taste. Cook the tomatoes thoroughly in the water,
    have the milk scalding (over water to prevent scorching). When
    the tomatoes are done add a large teaspoonful of salaratus,
    which will cause a violent effervescence. It is best to set the
    vessel in a pan before adding it to prevent waste. When the
    commotion has ceased add the milk and seasoning. When it is
    possible it is best to use more milk than water, and cream
    instead of butter. The soup is eaten with crackers and is by
    some preferred to oyster soup. This recipe is very valuable for
    those who keep abstinence days.</p>

    <p><b>Turkey Soup.</b>&mdash;Take the turkey bones and cook for
    one hour in water enough to cover them; then stir in a little
    dressing and a beaten egg. Take from the fire, and when the
    water has ceased boiling add a little butter with pepper and
    salt.</p>

    <p><b>Veal Gravy.</b>&mdash;Put in the stewpan bits of lard,
    then a few thin slices of ham, a few bits of butter, then
    slices of fillet of veal, sliced onions, carrots, parsnips,
    celery, a few cloves upon the meat, and two spoonfuls of broth;
    set it on the fire till the veal throws out its juices; then
    put it on a stronger fire till the meat catches to the bottom
    of the pan, and is brought to a proper color; then add a
    sufficient quantity of light broth, and simmer it upon a slow
    fire till the meat is well done. A little thyme and mushrooms
    may be added. Skim and sift it clear for use.</p>

    <p><b>Veal Soup.</b>&mdash;To a knuckle of veal of 6 pounds,
    put 7 or 9 quarts of water; boil down one-half; skim it well.
    This is better to do the day before you prepare the soup for
    the table. Thicken it by rubbing flour, butter, and water
    together. Season with salt and mace. When done
    <ins class="correction"
     title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'and'.">add</ins>
     one pint new milk; let it just come to a boil; then pour
     into a soup dish, lined with macaroni well cooked.</p>

    <p><b>Vegetable Soup.</b>&mdash;Pare and slice five or six
    cucumbers; and add to these as many cos lettuces, a sprig or
    two of mint, two or three onions, some pepper and salt, a pint
    and a half of young peas and a little parsley. Put these, with
    half a pound of fresh butter, into a saucepan, to stew in their
    own liquor, near a gentle fire, half an hour, then pour two
    quarts of boiling water to the vegetables, and stew them two
    hours; rub down a little flour into a teacupful of water, boil
    it with the rest twenty minutes, and serve it.</p>

    <p><b>Vermicelli Soup.</b>&mdash;Boil tender 1/2 lb. of
    vermicelli in a quart of rich gravy; take half of it out, and
    add to it more gravy; boil till the vermicelli can be pulped
    through a sieve. To both put a pint of boiling cream, a little
    salt, and 1/4 lb. of Parmesan cheese. Serve with rasped bread.
    Add two or three eggs, if you like.</p>

    <p><b>Brown Vermicelli Soup.</b>&mdash;Is made in the same
    manner, leaving out the eggs and cream, and adding one quart of
    strong beef gravy.</p>

    <h3>HOW TO COOK VEGETABLES</h3>

    <p><b>How to Boil Artichokes.</b>&mdash;If the artichokes are
    very young, about an inch of the stalk can be left; but should
    they be full grown, the stalk must be cut quite close. Wash
    them well and put them into strong salt and water to soak for a
    couple of hours. Pull away a few of the lower leaves, and snip
    off the points of all. Fill a saucepan with water, throw some
    salt into it, let it boil up, and then remove the scum from the
    top; put the artichokes in, with the stalks upward, and let
    them boil until the leaves can be loosened easily; this will
    take from thirty to forty minutes, according to the age of the
    artichokes. The saucepan should not be covered during the time
    they are boiling. Rich, melted butter is always sent to the
    table with them.</p>

    <p><b>New Mode to Dress Asparagus.</b>&mdash;Scrape the grass,
    tie it up in bundles, and cut the ends off an even length. Have
    ready a saucepan, with boiling water, and salt in proportion of
    a heaped saltspoonful to a quart of water. Put in the grass,
    standing it on the bottom with the green heads out of the
    water, so that they are not liable to be boiled off. If the
    water boils too fast, dash in a little cold water. When the
    grass has boiled a quarter of an hour it will be sufficiently
    done; remove it from the saucepan, cut off the ends down to the
    edible part, arrange it on a dish in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page126"
       id="page126"></a>[pg 126]</span> a round pyramid, with the
       heads toward the middle of the dish, and boil some eggs
       hard; cut them in two, and place them round the dish quite
       hot. Serve melted butter in a sauce-tureen; and those who
       like it rub the yoke of a hard egg into the butter, which
       makes a delicious sauce to the asparagus.</p>

    <p><b>How to Boil Asparagus.</b>&mdash;Scrape the asparagus;
    tie them in small bunches; boil them in a large pan of water
    with salt in it; before you dish them up toast some slices of
    bread, and then dip them in the boiling water; lay the
    asparagus on the toasts; pour on them rich melted butter, and
    serve hot.</p>

    <p><b>Ragout of Asparagus.</b>&mdash;Cut small asparagus like
    green peas; the best method is to break them off first; then
    tie them in small bunches to cut, boil them till half done;
    then drain them, and finish with butter, a little broth, herbs,
    two cloves, and a sprig of savory. When done, take out the
    cloves, herbs, etc., mix two yolks of eggs, with a little
    flour, and broth, to garnish a first course dish. But if you
    intend to serve it in a second course mix cream, a little salt,
    and sugar.</p>

    <p><b>French Beans, a la Creme.</b>&mdash;Slice the beans and
    boil them in water with salt. When soft, drain. Put into a
    stewpan two ounces of fresh butter, the yolks of three eggs,
    beaten up into a gill of cream, and set over a slow fire. When
    hot, add a spoonful of vinegar, simmer for five minutes.</p>

    <p><b>To Preserve French Beans for Winter.</b>&mdash;Pick them
    young, and throw into a little wooden keg a layer of them three
    inches deep; then sprinkle them with salt, put another layer of
    beans, and do the same as high as you think proper, alternately
    with salt, but not too much of this. Lay over them a plate, or
    cover of wood, that will go into the keg, and put a heavy stone
    on it. A pickle will rise from the beans and salt. If they are
    too salt, the soaking and boiling will not be sufficient to
    make them pleasant to the taste.</p>

    <p><b>Stewed Beans.</b>&mdash;Boil them in water in which a
    lump of butter has been placed; preserve them as white as you
    can; chop a few sweet herbs with some parsley very fine; then
    stew them in a pint of the water in which the leaves have been
    boiled, and to which a quarter of a pint of cream has been
    added; stew until quite tender, then add the beans, and stew
    five minutes, thickening with butter and flour.</p>

    <p><b>How to Boil Broccoli.</b>&mdash;Peel the thick skin of
    the stalks, and boil for nearly a quarter of an hour, with a
    little bit of soda, then put in salt, and boil five minutes
    more. Broccoli and savoys taste better when a little bacon is
    boiled with them.</p>

    <p><b>How to boil Cabbage.</b>&mdash;Cut off the outside
    leaves, and cut it in quarters; pick it well, and wash it
    clean; boil it in a large quantity of water, with plenty of
    salt in it; when it is tender and a fine light green, lay it on
    a sieve to drain, but do not squeeze it, it will take off the
    flavor; have ready some very rich melted butter, or chop it
    with cold butter. Greens must be boiled the same way. Strong
    vegetables like turnips and cabbage, etc., require much
    water.</p>

    <p><b>Cabbage Salad.</b>&mdash;Three eggs well beaten, one cup
    of vinegar, two tablespoons of mustard, salt and pepper, one
    tablespoon of butter; let this mixture come to a boil, when
    cool add seven tablespoons of cream, half a head of cabbage
    shaved fine.</p>

    <p><b>How to Boil Cauliflowers.</b>&mdash;Strip the leaves
    which you do not intend to use, and put the cauliflowers into
    salt and water some time to force out snails, worms, etc. Boil
    them twelve minutes on a drainer in plenty of water, then add
    salt, and boil five or six minutes longer. Skim well while
    boiling. Take out and drain. Serve with melted butter, or a
    sauce made of butter, cream, pepper and salt.</p>

    <p><b>How to Fry Cauliflowers.</b>&mdash;Wash as before. Boil
    twenty or thirty minutes; cut it into small portions, and cool.
    Dip the portions twice into a batter made of flour, milk and
    egg, and fry them in butter. Serve with gravy.</p>

    <p><b>Cucumbers for Immediate Use.</b>&mdash;Slice, sprinkle
    with salt; let them stand several hours, drain, and then put to
    them sliced onions, vinegar to cover them, and salt, pepper,
    etc. Cayenne pepper and ground mustard render them
    wholesome.</p>

    <p><b>Stewed Celery.</b>&mdash;Wash and clean six or eight
    heads of celery, let them be about three inches long; boil
    tender and pour off all the water; beat the yolks of four eggs,
    and mix with half a pint of cream, mace and salt; set it over
    the fire with the celery, and keep shaking until it thickens,
    then serve hot.</p>

    <p><b>Cold Slaw.</b>&mdash;Half a head of cabbage cut very
    fine, a stalk of celery cut fine&mdash;or teaspoon of celery
    seed&mdash;or, a tablespoon of celery essence, four hard-boiled
    eggs, whites chopped very fine, a teaspoon of mustard, a
    tablespoon of butter and the yolks of the boiled eggs, salt and
    pepper, mix well; take an egg well beaten and stir in a cup of
    boiling vinegar, pour over and cover for a few minutes.</p>

    <p><b>Egg-Plant.</b>&mdash;Slice the egg-plant an eighth of an
    inch in thickness, pare it, and sprinkle salt over it an hour
    before cooking; then drain off all the water, beat up the yolk
    of an egg, clip the slices first in the egg, and then in crumbs
    of bread; fry a nice brown. Serve hot, and free from fat.</p>

    <p><b>How to Cook Egg-Plant.</b>&mdash;Cut the egg-plant in
    slices half an inch thick, sprinkle a thin layer of salt
    between the slices, and lay them one over the other; and let
    them stand an hour. This draws out the bitter principal from
    the egg-plant, and also a part of the water. Then lay each
    slice in flour, put in hot fat and fry it brown on both sides.
    Or boil the egg-plant till tender, remove the skin, mash fine,
    mix with an equal quantity of bread or cracker crumbs, and
    salt, pepper and bake half an hour. This makes a delightful
    dish, and a very digestible one, as it has so little oily
    matter in it.</p>

    <p><b>How to Broil Mushrooms.</b>&mdash;Pare some large, open
    mushrooms, leaving the stalks on, paring them to a point; wash
    them well, and turn them on the back of a drying sieve to
    drain. Put into a stewpan two ounces of butter, some chopped
    parsley, and shalots, then fry them for a minute on the fire;
    when melted, place your mushroom stalks upward on a saucepan,
    then pour the butter and parsley over all the mushrooms; pepper
    and salt them well with black pepper put them in the oven to
    broil; when done, put a little good stock to them, give them a
    boil and dish them, pour the liquor over them, adding more
    gravy, but let it be put in hot.</p>

    <p><b>How to Pickle Onions.</b>&mdash;Take two quarts of the
    small white round onions. Scald them in very strong salt and
    water. Just let them boil. Strain, peel, place in jars; cover
    them with the best white wine vinegar. In two days pour all the
    vinegar off, and boil it half an hour, with a teaspoonful of
    cayenne pepper, 1 oz. of ginger, 16 cloves, 1/2 oz. ground
    mustard, 2 ozs. mustard seed. When cold, pour upon the onions.
    Some persons prefer the vinegar boiling hot.</p>

    <p><b>How to Fricassee Parsnips.</b>&mdash;Boil in milk till
    they are soft, then cut them lengthwise in bits two or three
    inches long, and simmer in a white sauce, made of two
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"
       id="page127"></a>[pg 127]</span> spoonfuls of broth, and a
       bit of mace, half a cupful of cream, a bit of butter, and
       some flour, pepper and salt.</p>

    <p><b>How to Mash Parsnips.</b>&mdash;Boil them tender, scrape
    then mash them in a stewpan with a little cream, a good piece
    of butter, and pepper and salt.</p>

    <p><b>How to Stew Parsnips.</b>&mdash;Boil them tender; scrape
    and cut into slices; put them into a saucepan with cream
    enough; for sauce, a piece of butter rolled in flour, and a
    little salt; shake the saucepan often, when the cream boils,
    pour them into a dish.</p>

    <p><b>How to Boil Peas.</b>&mdash;Peas should not be shelled
    long before they are wanted, nor boiled in much water; when the
    water boils, put them in with a little salt (some add a little
    loaf sugar, but if they are sweet of themselves, it is
    superfluous); when the peas begin to dent in the middle they
    are boiled enough. Strain, and put a piece of butter in the
    dish, and stir. A little mint should be boiled with the
    peas.</p>

    <p><b>Puree Of Potatoes.</b>&mdash;This differs from mashed
    potatoes only in the employment of more milk and butter, and in
    the whole being carefully reduced to a perfectly smooth, thick,
    cream-like mixture. Where economy is a great object, and where
    rich dishes are not desired, the following is an admirable mode
    of mashing potatoes: Boil them till thoroughly done, having
    added a handful of salt to the water, then dry them well, and
    with two forks placed back to back beat the whole up until no
    lumps are left. If done rapidly, potatoes thus cooked are
    extremely light and digestible.</p>

    <p><b>How to Boil Potatoes.</b>&mdash;Boil in a saucepan
    without lid, with only sufficient water to cover them; more
    would spoil them, as the potatoes contain much water, and it
    requires to be expelled. When the water nearly boils pour it
    off, and add cold water, with a good portion of salt. The cold
    water sends the heat from the surface to the center of the
    potato, and makes it mealy. Boiling with a lid on often
    produces cracking.</p>

    <p><b>New Potatoes.</b>&mdash;Should be cooked soon after
    having been dug; wash well, and boil.</p>

    <p>The Irish, who boil potatoes to perfection, say they should
    always be boiled in their <i>jackets</i>; as peeling them for
    boiling is only offering a premium for water to run through the
    potato, and rendering it sad and unpalatable; they should be
    well washed, and put into cold water.</p>

    <p><b>New Potatoes.</b>&mdash;Have them as freshly dug as may
    be convenient; the longer they have been out of the ground the
    less well-flavored they are. Well wash them, rub off the skins
    with a coarse cloth or brush, and put them into boiling water,
    to which has been added salt, at the rate of one heaped
    teaspoonful to two quarts. Let them boil till tender&mdash;try
    them with a fork; they will take from ten or fifteen minutes to
    half an hour, according to size. When done, pour away the
    water, and set by the side of the fire, with the lid aslant.
    When they are quite dry, have ready a hot vegetable dish, and
    in the middle of it put a piece of butter the size of a
    walnut&mdash;some people like more&mdash;heap the potatoes
    round it and over it, and serve immediately. We have seen very
    young potatoes, no larger than a marble, parboiled, and then
    fried in cream till they are of a fine auburn color; or else,
    when larger, boiled till nearly ready, then sliced and fried in
    cream, with pepper, salt, a very little nutmeg, and a flavoring
    of lemon juice. Both make pretty little supper dishes.</p>

    <p><b>Potatoes Roasted under the Meat.</b>&mdash;These are very
    good; they should be nicely browned. Half boil large mealy
    potatoes; put into a baking dish, under the meat roasting;
    ladle the gravy upon them occasionally. They are best done in
    an oven.</p>

    <p><b>Potato Ribbons.</b>&mdash;Cut the potatoes into slices,
    rather more than half an inch thick, and then pare round and
    round in very long ribbons. Place them in a pan of cold water,
    and a short time before wanted drain them from the water. Fry
    them in hot lard, or good dripping, until crisp and browned;
    dry them on a soft cloth, pile them on a hot dish, and season
    with salt and cayenne.</p>

    <p><b>Potato Rolls.</b>&mdash;Boil three lbs. of potatoes;
    crush and work them with two ozs. of butter and as much milk as
    will cause them to pass through a colander; take half a pint of
    yeast and half a pint of warm water; mix with the potatoes;
    pour the whole upon 5 lbs. of flour; add salt; knead it well;
    if too thick, put to it a little more milk and warm water;
    stand before the fire for an hour to rise; work it well and
    make it into rolls. Bake it half an hour.</p>

    <p><b>Potato Rissoles.</b>&mdash;Boil the potatoes floury; mash
    them, seasoning them with salt and a little cayenne; mince
    parsley very fine, and work up with the potatoes, adding
    eschalot, also chopped small. Bind with yolk of egg, roll into
    balls, and fry with fresh butter over a clear fire. Meat shred
    finely, bacon or ham may be added.</p>

    <p><b>Potato Sautees.</b>&mdash;These are even more agreeable
    with meat than fried potatoes. Cold boiled potatoes are sliced
    up, and tossed up in a saucepan with butter, mixed with a
    little chopped parsley, till they are lightly browned. Pure
    goose or other dripping is by many cooks preferred to butter
    for this purpose.</p>

    <p><b>Potato Souffles.</b>&mdash;The delicious blistered
    potatoes are prepared as follows: The potatoes, if small, are
    simply cut in halves; if large, cut in three or more slices;
    these are fried in the usual way, but are taken out before they
    are quite done, and set aside to get cold; when wanted they are
    fried a second time, but only till they are of a light golden
    color, not brown.</p>

    <p><b>Tomatoes.</b>&mdash;Cut ripe tomatoes into slices, put
    them in a buttered dish with some bread crumbs, butter, pepper
    and salt, and bake till slightly brown on top.</p>

    <p><b>Forced Tomatoes.</b>&mdash;Prepare the following
    forcemeat: Two ounces of mushrooms, minced small, a couple of
    shalots, likewise minced, a small quantity of parsley, a slice
    of lean ham, chopped fine, a few savory herbs, and a little
    cayenne and salt. Put all these ingredients into a saucepan
    with a lump of butter, and stew all together until quite
    tender, taking care that they do not burn. Put it by to cool,
    and then mix with them some bread crumbs and the well beaten
    yolks of two eggs. Choose large tomatoes, as nearly of the same
    size as possible, cut a slice from the stalk end of each, and
    take out carefully the seeds and juice; fill them with the
    mixture which has already been prepared, strew them over with
    bread and some melted butter, and bake them in a quick oven
    until they assume a rich color. They are a good accompaniment
    to veal or calf's head.</p>

    <p><b>To Mash Turnips.</b>&mdash;Boil them very tender. Strain
    till no water is left. Place in a saucepan over a gentle fire,
    and stir well a few minutes. Do not let them burn. Add a little
    cream, or milk, or both, salt butter and pepper. Add a
    tablespoonful of fine sugar. Stir and simmer five minutes
    longer.</p>

    <p><b>To Boil or Stew Vegetable Marrow.</b>&mdash;This
    excellent vegetable may be boiled as asparagus. When boiled,
    divide it lengthways into two, and serve it upon a toast
    accompanied by melted butter; or when nearly boiled, divide it
    as above, and stew gently in gravy like cucumbers. Care should
    be taken to choose young ones not exceeding six inches in
    length.</p>

    <h2>HOW TO CALCULATE.</h2>

    <h3>PRACTICAL RULES, SHORT METHODS, AND PROBLEMS USED IN
    BUSINESS COMPUTATIONS.</h3>

    <p>Rapidity and accuracy in making estimates and in figuring
    out the result of business transactions is of the greatest
    necessity to the man of business. A miscalculation may involve
    the loss of hundreds or thousands of dollars, in many cases,
    while a slow and tedious calculation involves loss of time and
    the advantage which should have been seized at the moment. It
    is proposed in the following pages to give a few brief methods
    and practical rules for performing calculations which occur in
    every-day transactions among men, presuming that a fair
    knowledge of the ordinary rules of arithmetic has previously
    been attained.</p>

    <h3>ADDITION.</h3>

    <p>To be able to add up long columns of figures rapidly and
    correctly is of great value to the merchant. This requires not
    only a knowledge of addition, but in order to have a correct
    result, one that can be relied upon, it requires concentration
    of the mind. Never allow other thoughts to be flitting through
    the mind, or any outside matter to disturb or draw it away from
    the figures, until the result is obtained. Write the tens to be
    carried each time in a smaller figure underneath the units, so
    that afterwards any column can be added over again without
    repeating the entire operation. By the practice of addition the
    eye and mind soon become accustomed to act rapidly, and this is
    the art of addition. Grouping figures together is a valuable
    aid in rapid addition, as we group letters into words in
    reading.</p>

    <table summary="Addition."
           align="center">
        <tr>
            <td align="right">862 \</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td align="right">538 /</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td align="right">674 \</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td align="right">843 /</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td align="right">____</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>2917&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Thus, in the above example, we do not say 3 and 4 are 7 and
    8 are 15 and 2 are 17, but speak the sum of the couplet, thus 7
    and 10 are 17, and in the second column, 12 and 9 are 21. This
    method of grouping the figures soon becomes easy and reduces
    the labor of addition about one-half, while those somewhat
    expert may group three or more figures, still more reducing the
    time and labor, and sometimes two or more columns may be added
    at once, by ready reckoners.</p>

    <p>Another method is to group into tens when it can be
    conveniently done, and still another method in adding up long
    columns is to add from the bottom to the top, and whenever the
    numbers make even 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50, write with pencil a
    small figure opposite, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5, and then proceed to add
    as units. The sum of these figures thus set out will be the
    number of tens to be carried to the next column.</p>

    <h3>SHORT METHODS OF MULTIPLICATION.</h3>

    <p>For certain classes of examples in multiplication short
    methods may be employed and the labor of calculation reduced,
    but of course for the great bulk of multiplications no
    practical abbreviation remains. A person having much
    multiplying to do should learn the table up to twenty, which
    can be done without much labor.</p>

    <p>To multiply any number by 10, 100, or 1000, simply annex
    one, two, or three ciphers, as the case may be. If it is
    desired to multiply by 20, 300, 5000, or a number greater than
    one with any number of ciphers annexed, multiply first by the
    number and then annex as many ciphers as the multiplier
    contains.</p>

    <p class="i50">TABLE.</p>

    <p class="i6">5 cents equal 1/20 of a dollar.<br />
    10 cents equal 1/10 of a dollar.<br />
    12-1/2 cents equal 1/8 of a dollar.<br />
    16-2/3 cents equal 1/6 of a dollar.<br />
    20 cents equal 1/5 of a dollar.<br />
    25 cents equal 1/4 of a dollar.<br />
    33-1/3 cents equal 1/3 of a dollar.<br />
    50 cents equal 1/2 of a dollar.</p>

    <p>Articles of merchandise are often bought and sold by the
    pound, yard, or gallon, and whenever the price is an equal part
    of a dollar, as seen in the above table, the whole cost may be
    easily found by adding two ciphers to the number of pounds or
    yards and dividing by the equivalent in the table.</p>

    the price by the equivalent of the quantity as seen in the

    <h3>FRACTIONS.</h3>

    <p>Fractional parts of a cent should never be despised. They
    often make fortunes, and the counting of all the fractions may
    constitute the difference between the rich and the poor man.
    The business man readily understands the value of the
    fractional part of a bushel, yard, pound, or cent, and
    calculates them very sharply, for in them lies perhaps his
    entire profit.</p>

    <h4>TO REDUCE A FRACTION TO ITS SIMPLEST FORM.</h4>

    <p>Divide both the numerator and denominator by any number that
    will leave no remainder and repeat the operation until no
    number will divide them both.</p>

    <p><i>Example</i>. The simplest form of 36/45 is found by
    dividing by 9 = 4/5.</p>

    <p>To reduce a whole number and a fraction, as 4-1/2, to
    fractional form, multiply the whole number by the denominator,
    add the numerator and write the result over the denominator.
    Thus, 4 X 2 = 8 + = 9 placed over 2 is 9/2.</p>

    <h4>TO ADD FRACTIONS.</h4>

    <p>Reduce the fractions to like denominators, add their
    numerators and write the denominator under the result.</p>

    <p><i>Example</i>. Add 2/3 to 3/4.</p>

    <p>2/3 = 8/12, 3/4 = 9/12, 8/12 + 9/12 = 17/12 = 1-5/12.
    Ans.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"
       id="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span>

    <h4>TO SUBTRACT FRACTIONS.</h4>

    <p>Reduce the fractions to like denominators, subtract the
    numerators and write the denominators under the result.</p>

    <p><i>Example</i>. Find the difference between 4/5 and 3/4.</p>

    <p>4/5 = 16/20, 3/4 = 15/20, 16/20 - 15/20 = 1/20. Ans.</p>

    <h4>TO MULTIPLY FRACTIONS.</h4>

    <p>Multiply the numerators together for a new numerator and the
    denominators together for a new denominator.</p>

    <p><i>Example</i>. Multiply 7/8 by 5/6.</p>

    <p>7/8 x 5/6 = 35/48. Ans.</p>

    <h4>TO DIVIDE FRACTIONS.</h4>

    <p>Multiply the dividend by the divisor inverted.</p>

    <p><i>Example</i>. Divide 7/8 by 5/6.</p>

    <p>7/8 X 6/5 = 42/40. Reduced to simple form by dividing by 2
    is 21/20 = <ins class="correction"
     title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads '1^{1}'.">1-1/20.</ins>
     Ans.</p>

    <h4>TO MULTIPLY MIXED NUMBERS.</h4>

    <p>When two numbers are to be multiplied, one of which contains
    a fraction, first multiply the whole numbers together, then
    multiply the fraction by the other whole number, add the two
    results together for the correct answer.</p>

    <p>Common fractions may often be changed to decimals very

    <h4>TO CHANGE COMMON FRACTIONS TO DECIMALS.</h4>

    <p>Annex one or more ciphers to the numerator and divide by the
    denominator.</p>

    <p><i>Example</i>. Change 3/4 to a decimal. Ans..75.</p>

    <p>We add two ciphers to the 3, making it 300, and divide by 4,
    which gives us.75. In the same way 1/2 =.5, or 3/4 =.75, and so
    on. When a quantity is in dollars and fractions of a dollar,
    the fractions should always be thus reduced to cents and
    mills.</p>

    <p>The slide of Alpnach, extending from Mount Pilatus to Lake
    Lucerne, a distance of 8 miles, is composed of 25,000 trees,
    stripped of their bark, and laid at an inclination of 10 to 18
    degrees. Trees placed in the slide rush from the mountain into
    the lake in 6 minutes.</p>

    <p>The Alps comprise about 180 mountains, from 4,000 to 15,732
    feet high, the latter being the height of Mount Blanc, the
    highest spot in Europe. The summit is a sharp ridge, like the
    roof of a house, consisting of nearly vertical granite rocks.
    The ascent requires 2 days, 6 or 8 guides are required, and
    each guide is paid 100 francs ($20.00). It was ascended by two
    natives, Jacques Belmat and Dr. Packard, August 8, 1786, at 6
    a.m. They staid up 30 minutes, with the thermometer at 14
    degrees below the freezing point. The provisions froze in their
    pockets; their faces were frost-bitten, lips swollen, and their
    sight much weakened, but they soon recovered on their descent.
    De Saussure records in his ascent August 2, 1760, that the
    color of the sky was deep blue; the stars were visible in the
    shade; the barometer sunk to 16.08 inches (being 27.08 in
    Geneva) the thermometer was 26-1/2 degrees, in the sun 29
    degrees (being 87 degrees at Geneva). The thin air works the
    blood into a high fever, you feel as if you hardly touched the
    ground, and you scarcely make yourself heard. A French woman,
    Mademoiselle d'Angeville, ascended in September, 1840, being
    dragged up the last 1,200 feet by guides, and crying out: "If I
    die, carry me to the top." When there, she made them lift her
    up, that she might boast she had been higher than any man in
    Europe. The ascent of these awful solitudes is most perilous,
    owing to the narrow paths, tremendous ravines, icy barriers,
    precipices, etc. In many places every step has to be cut in the
    ice, the party being tied to each other by ropes, so that
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page131"
       id="page131"></a>[pg 131]</span> if one slips he may be held
       up by the rest, and silence is enforced, lest the noise of
       talking should dislodge the avalanches of the Aiguille du
       Midi. The view from the mountain is inexpressibly grand. On
       the Alps the limit of the vine is an elevation of 1,600
       feet; below 1,000 feet, figs, oranges and olives are
       produced. The limit of the oak is 3,800 feet, of the
       <ins class="correction"
       title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'chesnut'.">
       chestnut</ins> 2,800 feet, of the pine 6,500 feet, of heaths
       and furze to 8,700 and 9,700 feet; and perpetual snow exists
       at an elevation of 8,200 feet.</p>

    <p>On the Andes, in lat. 2 degrees, the limit of perpetual snow
    is 14,760 feet; in Mexico, lat. 19 degrees, the limit is 13,800
    feet; on the peak of Teneriffe, 11,454 feet; on Mount Etna,
    9,000 feet; on the Caucasus, 9,900 feet; in the Pyrenees, 8,400
    feet; in Lapland, 3,100 feet; in Iceland, 2,890 feet. The
    walnut ceases to grow at an elevation of 3,600 feet; the yellow
    pine at 6,200 feet; the ash at 4,800 feet, and the fir at 6,700
    feet. The loftiest inhabited spot on the globe is the Port
    House of Ancomarca, on the Andes, in Peru, 16,000 feet above
    the level of the sea. The 14th peak of the Himalayas, in Asia,
    25,659 feet high, is the loftiest mountain in the world.</p>

    <p>Lauterbrunnen is a deep part of an Alpine pass, where the
    sun hardly shines in winter. It abounds with falls, the most
    remarkable of which is the Staubbach, which falls over the Balm
    precipice in a drizzling spray from a height of 925 feet; best
    viewed in the morning sun or by moonlight. In general, it is
    like a gauze veil, with rainbows dancing up and down it, and
    when clouds hide the top of the mountain, it seems as poured
    out of the sky.</p>

    <p>In Canada, the falls of Montmorenci are 250 feet high, the
    falls of Niagara (the Horse Shoe Falls) are 158 feet high and
    2,000 feet wide, the American Falls are 164 feet high and 900
    feet wide. The Yosemite Valley Falls are 2,600 feet high, and
    the Ribbon Falls of the Yosemite are 3,300 feet high. The
    waterfall of the Arve, in Bavaria, is 2,000 feet.</p>

    <p>The ancient battering ram was of massive timber, 60 to 100
    feet long, fitted with an iron head. It was erected under
    shelter to protect the 60 or 100 men required to work it. The

    <p>Wire ropes for the transmission of power vary in size from
    3/8 to 7/8 inch diam. for from 3 to 300 horse power; to promote
    flexibility, the rope, made of iron, steel, or copper wire, as
    may be preferred, is provided with a core of hemp, and the
    speed is 1 mile per minute, more or less, as desired. The rope
    should run on a well-balanced, grooved, cast iron wheel, of
    from 4 to 15 feet diam., according as the transmitted power
    ranges from 3 to 300 horse; the groove should be well cushioned
    with soft material, as leather or rubber, for the formation of
    a durable bed for the rope. With good care the rope will last
    from 3 to 5 years.</p>

    <p>Cannon balls go furthest at an elevation of 30 degrees, and
    less as the balls are less; the range is furthest when fired
    from west to east in the direction of the earth's motion, which
    for the diurnal rotation on its axis, is at the rate of 1,037
    miles per hour, and in its orbit, 66,092 miles.</p>

    <p>The air's resistance is such that a cannon ball of 3 lbs.
    weight, diameter, 2.78 ins. moving with a velocity of 1,800
    feet per second, is resisted by a force equal to 156 lbs.</p>

    <p>Bricklayers ascend ladders with loads of 90 lbs., 1 foot per

    18, poplar 20, red pine 22.10, white pine 23. The charcoal used
    in gunpowder is made from willow, alder, and a few other woods.
    The charred timber found in the ruins of Herculaneum has

    <p>Air extracted from pure water, under an air pump, contains
    34.8 per cent. of oxygen. Fish breathe this air, respiring
    about 35 times per minute. The oxhydrogen lime light may be

    <p>1,000 cubic feet of 13 candle gas is equivalent to over 7
    gals. of sperm oil, 52.9 lbs. of tallow candles, and over 44
    lbs. of sperm candles.</p>

    <p>The time occupied by gas in traveling from a gas well (in
    Pennsylvania) through 32 miles of pipe was 22 minutes, pressure
    at the well was 55 lbs. per inch, pressure at discharge 49

    <p>At birth, the beats of the pulse are from 165 to 104, and
    the inspirations of breath from 70 to 23. From 15 to 20, the
    pulsations are from 90 to 57, the inspirations, from 24 to 16;
    from 29 to 50, the pulsations are 112 to 56, the inspirations
    23 to 11. In usual states it is 4 to 1. The action of the heart
    distributes 2 ozs. of blood from 70 to 80 times in a

    <p>The mean heat of the human body is 98 degs. and of the skin
    90 degs. Tea and coffee are usually drank at 110 degs. The
    deepest coal mine in England is at Killingworth, near
    Newcastle, and the mean annual temperature at 400 yards below
    the surface is 77 degrees, and at 300 yards 70 degrees, while
    at the surface it is but 48 degrees, being 1 degree of increase
    for every 15 yards. This explains the origin of hot springs,
    for at 3,300 yards the heat would be equal to boiling water,
    taking 20 yards to a degree. The heat of the Bath waters is 116
    degrees, hence they would appear to rise 1,320 yards.</p>

    <p>Peron relates that at the depth of 2,144 feet in the sea the
    thermometer falls to 45 degrees, when it is 86 degrees at the

    <p>The French removed a red granite column 95 feet high,
    weighing 210 tons, from Thebes, and carried it to Paris. The
    display of costly architectural ruins at Thebes is one of the
    most astonishing to be seen anywhere in the world. The ruins
    and costly buildings in old Eastern countries, are so vast in
    their proportions and so many in number that it would require
    volumes to describe them.</p>

    <p>Babel, now called Birs Nimroud, built at Babylon by Belus,
    was used as an observatory and as a temple of the Sun. It was
    composed of 8 square towers, one over the other, in all 670
    feet high, and the same dimensions on each side on the
    ground.</p>

    <p>The Coliseum at Rome, built by Vespasian for 100,000
    spectators, was in its longest diameter 615-5 feet, and in the
    shortest 510, embraced 5-1/2 acres, and was 120 feet high.
    Eight aqueducts supplied ancient Rome with water, delivering 40
    millions of cubit feet daily. That of Claudia was 47 miles long
    and 100 feet high, so as to furnish the hills. Martia was 41
    miles, of which 37 were on 7,000 acres 70 feet high. These vast
    erections would never have been built had the Romans known that
    water always rises to its own level.</p>

    <p>The Temple of Diana, at Ephesus, was 425 feet long and 225
    feet broad, with 127 columns, 60 feet high, to support the
    roof. It was 220 years in building.</p>

    <p>Solomon's Temple, built B.C. 1014, was 60 cubits or 107 feet
    in length, the breadth 20 cubits or 36 feet, and the height 30
    cubits or 54 feet. The porch was 36 feet long and 18 feet
    wide.</p>

    <p>The largest one of the Egyptian pyramids is 543 feet high,
    693 feet on the sides, and its base covers 11 acres. The layers
    of stones are 208 in number. Many stones are over 30 feet long,
    4 broad and 3 thick.</p>

    <p>The Temple of Ypsambul, in Nubia, is enormously massive and
    cut out of the solid rock. Belzoni found in it 4 immense
    figures, 65 feet high, 25 feet over the shoulders, with a face
    of 7 feet and the ears over 3 feet.</p>

    <p>Sesostris erected in the temple in Memphis immense statues
    of himself and his wife, 50 feet high, and of his children, 28
    feet.</p>

    <p>In the Temple of the Sun, at Baalbec, are stones more than
    60 feet long, 24 feet thick and 16 broad, each embracing 23,000
    cubic feet, cut, squared, sculptured, and transported from
    neighboring quarries. Six enormous columns are each 72 feet
    high, composed of 3 stones 7 feet in diameter. Sesostris is
    credited with having transported from the mountains of Arabia a
    rock 32 feet wide and 240 feet long.</p>

    <p>The engineering appliances used by the ancients in the
    movement of these immense masses are but imperfectly understood
    at the present day.</p>

    <p>During modern times, a block of granite weighing 1,217 tons,
    now used as the pedestal of the equestrian statute of Peter the
    Great, at St. Petersburg, was transported 4 miles by land over
    a railway, and 13 miles in a vast caisson by water. The railway
    consisted of two lines of timber furnished with hard metal
    grooves; between these grooves were placed spheres of hard
    brass about 6 inches in diameter. On these spheres the frame
    with its massive load was easily moved by 60 men, working at
    capstans with treble purchase blocks.</p>

    <p>In 1716 Swedenborg contrived to transport (on rolling
    machines of his own invention) over valleys and mountains, 2
    galleys, 5 large boats and 1 sloop, from Stromstadt to Iderfjol
    (which divides Sweden from Norway on the South), a distance of
    14 miles, by which means Charles XII. was able to carry on his
    plans, and under cover of the galleys and boats to transport on
    pontoons his heavy artillery to the very walls of
    Frederickshall.</p>

    <p>Belzoni considered the tract between the first and second
    cataract of the Nile as the hottest on the globe, owing to
    there being no rain. The natives do not credit the phenomenon
    of water falling from above. Hence it is that all monuments are
    so nicely preserved. Buckingham found a building left
    unfinished about 4,000 years ago, and the chalk marks on the
    stones were still perfect.</p>

    <p>Pompey's Pillar is 92 feet high, and 27-1/2 round at the
    base.</p>

    <p>Water is the absolute master, former and secondary agent of
    the power of motion in everything terrestrial. It is the
    irresistible power which elaborates everything, and the waters
    contain more organized beings than the land.</p>

    <p>Rivers hold in suspension 100th of their volume (more or
    less) of mud, so that if 36 cubic miles of water (the estimated
    quantity) flow daily into the sea, 0.36 cubic miles of soil are
    daily displaced. The Rhine carries to the sea every day 145,980
    cubic feet of mud. The Po carries out the land 228 feet per
    annum, consequently Adria which 2,500 years ago was on the sea,
    is now over 20 miles from it.</p>

    <p>The enormous amount of alluvium deposited by the Mississippi
    is almost incalculable, and constantly renders necessary
    extensive engineering operations in order to remove the
    impediments to navigation.</p>

    <p>As an exponent of the laws of friction, it may be stated
    that a square stone weighing 1,080 lbs. which required a force
    of 758 lbs. to drag it along the floor of a quarry, roughly
    chiseled, required only a force of 22 lbs. to move it when
    mounted on a platform and rollers over a plank
    floor.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"

    <p>The flight of wild ducks is estimated at 90 miles per hour,
    that of the swift at 200 miles, carrier pigeons 38 miles,
    swallows 60 miles, migratory birds have crossed the
    Mediterranean at a speed of 120 miles per hour.</p>

    <p>The Nile has a fall of 6 ins. in 1,000 miles. The rise of
    the river commences in June, continuing until the middle of
    August, attaining an elevation of from 24 to 26 feet, and
    flowing the valley of Egypt 12 miles wide. In 1829 it rose to
    26 cubits, by which 30,000 persons were drowned. It is a
    terrible climate to live in, owing to the festering heat and
    detestable exhalations from the mud, etc., left on the retiring
    of the Nile, which adds about 4 inches to the soil in a
    century, and encroaches on the sea 16 feet every year. Bricks
    have been found at the depth of 60 feet, showing the vast
    antiquity of the country. In productiveness of soil it is
    excelled by no other in the world.</p>

    <p>How to Splice a Belt in Order to Make it Run Like an Endless
    Belt.&mdash;Use the toughest yellow glue prepared in the
    ordinary way, while hot, stirring in thoroughly about 20 per
    cent of its weight of tannic acid, or extract of tan bark.
    Apply to the splice and quickly clamp together. The splice
    should be made of scarfed edges extending 3 to 6 inches back,
    according to thickness of belt. The surface to be perfectly
    clean and free from oil.</p>

    <p>How Many Pounds of Coal it Requires to Maintain Steam of
    One-Horse Power per Hour.&mdash;Anthracite 1-1/2 to 5 pounds,
    according to the economy of boiler and engine. Bituminous and
    anthracite coal are very nearly equal for equal qualities. They
    both vary from 7 to 10 pounds of water evaporated per pound of
    coal from a temperature of 212 degrees.</p>

    <p>A Formula for Collodio-bromide Emulsion that is
    Rapid.&mdash;Ether s.g. 0.720, 4 fluid ounces; alcohol s.g.
    0.820, 2-1/2 fluid ounces; pyroxyline, 40 grains; castile soap
    dissolved in alcohol, 30 grains; bromide of ammonium and
    cadmium, 56 grains.</p>

    <p>How to Deaden the Noise of Steam While Blowing off Through a
    Wrought Iron Stand Pipe.&mdash;The sound may be much modified
    by enlarging the end of the pipe like a trumpet or cone; which
    should be long, 20 or 30 times the diameter of the pipe,
    opening to 4 or 5 times its initial size.</p>

    <p>Why Fusible Plugs are Put in the Crown Sheet of Locomotive
    Boilers.&mdash;To save the crown sheet from burning in case of
    low water, when the plug melts and lets the steam and water
    into the fire chamber to dampen and put out the fire as well as
    to make an alarm. They may also be employed on other forms of
    boilers, and are much used in connection with whistles for
    low-water alarms only. Boilers should not be blown out for
    cleaning with fire under them or while the walls (if set in
    brick) are hot enough to do damage to the iron shell.
    Locomotive boilers may be blown out very soon after the fire is
    entirely removed. All brick-set boilers should be left several
    hours after the fire is drawn before blowing off for
    cleaning.</p>

    <p>How to Lace a Quarter Turn Belt so as to Have an Equal
    Strain on Both Edges of the Belt.&mdash;Begin on the outside of
    the belt at the middle, pass one end of the lacing through one
    end of the belt and bring it out through the corresponding hole
    of the other end of the belt, laying it diagonally off to the
    left. Now pass the other end of the lacing through the hole
    last used, and carry it over the first strand of the lacing on
    the inside of the belt, passing it through the first hole used,
    and lay it diagonally off to the right. Now proceed to pass the
    lacing through the holes of the belt in a zigzag course,
    leaving all the strands inside the belt parallel with the belt,
    and all the strands outside the belt oblique. Pass the lace
    twice through the holes nearest the edge of the belt, then
    return the lace in the reverse order toward the center of the
    belt, so as to cross all the oblique strands, and make all the
    inside strands double. Finally pass the end of the lacing
    through the first hole used, then outward through an awl hole,
    then hammering it down to cause it to hold. The left side is to
    be laced in a similar way.</p>

    <p>A Useful Hint to Draughtsmen.&mdash;To strain drawing paper
    on a board, cut the paper to the size required, lay it on the
    board face downwards and thoroughly wet the surface with a damp
    sponge or brush, then turn it over and wet the face in the same
    way; roll it up tightly and let it stay so for five or six
    minutes, unroll it, and turn up the edges about an inch all
    around. Take liquid glue (Jackson's is the best) and apply it
    carefully to the edges, then turn them down, and with a paper
    knife press them to the board all around. Put the board in an
    inclined position where it is not too dry or warm, or the paper
    will dry too fast and tear. If it is allowed to dry slowly the
    surface will be perfectly even and smooth, and a pleasure to
    draw upon.</p>

    <p>Joints for Hot Water Pipes.&mdash;Sal-ammoniac, 2 oz.;
    sublimed sulphur, 1 oz.; cast-iron filings, 1 lb. Mix in a
    mortar, and keep the powder dry. When it is to be used, mix it
    with twenty times its weight of clean iron filings, and grind
    the whole in a mortar. Wet with water until it becomes of
    convenient consistence. After a time it becomes as hard and
    strong as any part of the metal.</p>

    <p>When the Process of Galvanizing Iron was First
    Known.&mdash;A. The process of coating iron with zinc, or zinc
    and tin, is a French invention, and was patented in England in
    1837.</p>

    <p>A Timber Test.&mdash;The soundness of timber may be
    ascertained by placing the ear close to one end of the log,
    while another person delivers a succession of smart blows with
    a hammer or mallet upon the opposite end, when a continuance of
    the vibrations will indicate to an experienced ear even the
    degree of soundness. If only a dull thud meets the ear, the
    listener may be certain that unsoundness exists.</p>

    <p>Useful Hints and Recipes.&mdash;Following is a comparative
    statement of the toughness of various woods.&mdash;Ash, 100;
    beech, 85; cedar of Lebanon, 84; larch, 83; sycamore and common
    walnut, each, 68; occidental plane, 66; oak, hornbeam and
    Spanish mahogany, each, 62; teak and acacia, each, 58; elm and
    young chestnut, 52.</p>

    <p>An <ins class="correction"
         title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'ingenius'.">
    ingenious</ins> device for stretching emery cloth for use in
    the workshop consists of a couple of strips of wood about 14
    in. long, hinged longitudinally, and of round, half-round,
    triangular, or any other shape in cross section. On the inside
    faces of the wood strips are pointed studs, fitting into holes
    on the opposite side. The strip of emery cloth is laid on to
    one set of the studs, and the file, as it is called, closed,
    which fixes the strip on one side. It is then similarly fixed
    on the other side, and thus constitutes what is called an emery
    file and which is a handy and convenient arrangement for
    workshop use.</p>

    <p>Method of making Artificial Whetstones.&mdash;Gelatine of
    good quality is dissolved in its own weight of water, the
    operation being conducted in a dark room. To the solution one
    and a half per cent. of bichromate of potash is added, which
    has previously been dissolved in a little water. A quantity of
    very fine emery, equal to nine times the weight of the
    gelatine, is <ins class="correction"
    title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'itimately'.">
    intimately</ins> mixed with the gelatine solution.
    Pulverized flint may be substituted for emery. The mass is
    molded into any desired shape, and is then consolidated by
    heavy pressure. It is dried by exposure to strong sunlight for
    several hours.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page134"

    <p>How to Toughen Paper.&mdash;A plan for rendering paper as
    tough as wood or leather has been recently introduced; it
    consists in mixing chloride of zinc with the pulp in the course
    of manufacture. It has been found that the greater the degree
    of concentration of the zinc solution, the greater will be the
    toughness of the paper. It can be used for making boxes and for
    roofing.</p>

    <p>How to Mend a Broken File.&mdash;There is no tool so easily
    broken as the file that the machinist has to work with, and is
    about the first thing that snaps when a kit of tools gets upset
    upon the cross-beam of a machine or a tool board from the bed
    of an engine lathe. It cannot even be passed from one workman
    to another without being broken, if the file is a new one or
    still good for anything, if an apprentice has got anything to
    do with it, and they are never worth mending, however great may
    be their first cost, unless the plaster of Paris and lime
    treatment can make a perfect weld without injuring the steel or
    disturbing the form of the teeth. Steel that is left as hard as
    a file is very brittle, and soft solder can hold as much on a
    steady pull if it has a new surface to work from. Take a file,
    as soon as it is broken, and wet the break with zinc dissolved
    in muriatic acid, and then tin over with the soldering iron.
    This must be done immediately as soon as the file is broken, as
    the break begins to oxydize when exposed to the air. and in an
    hour or two will gather sufficient to make it impossible for
    the parts to adhere. Heat the file as warm as it will bear
    without disturbing its temper as soon as well tinned, and press
    the two pieces firmly together, squeezing out nearly all the
    solder, and hold in place until the file cools. This can be
    done with very little to trim off, and every portion of the
    break fitting accurately in place. Bring both pieces in line
    with each other, and, for a file, it is as strong in one place
    as in another, and is all that could be asked for under the
    very best of welding treatment.</p>

    <p>What will Fasten Pencil Markings, to Prevent
    Blurring.&mdash;Immerse paper containing the markings to be
    preserved in a bath of clear water, then flow or immerse in
    milk a moment; hang up to dry. Having often had recourse to
    this method, in preserving pencil and crayon drawings, I will
    warrant it a sure cure.</p>

    <p>How to Transfer Newspaper Prints to Glass.&mdash;First coat
    the glass with dammar varnish, or else with Canada balsam,
    mixed with an equal volume of oil of turpentine, and let it dry
    until it is very sticky, which takes half a day or more. The
    printed paper to be transferred should be well soaked in soft
    water, and carefully laid upon the prepared glass, after
    removing surplus water with blotting paper, and pressed upon
    it, so that no air bubbles or drops of water are seen
    underneath. This should dry a whole day before it is touched;
    then with wetted fingers begin to rub off the paper at the
    back. If this be skillfully done, almost the whole of the paper
    can be removed, leaving simply the ink upon the varnish. When
    the paper has been removed, another coat of varnish will serve
    to make the whole more transparent. This recipe is sold at from
    $3 to $5 by itinerants.</p>

    <p>A Liquid Cement for Cementing Leather, that Will Not be
    Affected by the Action of Water.&mdash;A good cement for
    splicing leather is gutta percha dissolved in carbon
    disulphide, until it is of the thickness of treacle; the parts
    to be cemented must first be well thinned down, then pour a
    small quantity of the cement on both ends, spreading it well so
    as to fill the pores of the leather; warm the parts over a fire
    for about half a minute, apply them quickly together, and
    hammer well. The bottle containing the cement should be tightly
    corked, and kept in a cool place.</p>

    <p>The Quickest and Best Way to Drill Holes for Water Pipes in
    Rough Plate Glass.&mdash;Use a hardened (file temper) drill,
    with spirits of turpentine and camphor to make the drill bite.
    A broken file in a breast brace will do good work if a power
    drill is not obtainable.</p>

    <p>A Recipe for Making Printers' Inks.&mdash;For black ink:
    Take of balsam of copaiba (pure), 9 ounces; lamp black, 3
    ounces; indigo and Prussian blue, of each half an ounce; Indian
    red, 3/4 ounce; yellow soap (dry), 3 ounces; grind the mixture
    to an impalpable smoothness by means of a stone and muller.
    Canada balsam may be substituted for balsam of copaiba where
    the smell of the latter is objectionable, but the ink then
    dries very quickly. The red inks are similarly made by using
    such pigments as carmine, lakes, vermilion, chrome yellow, red
    lead, orange red, Indian red and Venetian red.</p>

    <p>A Cement to Stick White Metal Tops on Glass
    Bottles.&mdash;One of the best cap cements consists of resin, 5
    ounces; beeswax, 1 ounce; red ocher or Venetian red in powder,
    1 ounce. Dry the earth thoroughly on a stove at a temperature
    above 212&deg; Fah. Melt the wax and resin together, and stir
    in the powder by degrees. Stir until cold, lest the earthy
    matter settle to the bottom.</p>

    <p>The Correct Meaning of the Tonnage of a Vessel.&mdash;The
    law defines very carefully how the tonnage of different vessels
    shall be calculated. An approximate rule for finding the gross
    tonnage is to multiply the length of keel between
    perpendiculars by the breadth of vessel and depth of hold, all
    in feet, and dividing the product by 100. It is generally
    assumed that 40 cubic feet shall constitute a ton, and the
    tonnage of a vessel is considered to be the multiple of this
    ton, which most closely corresponds with the internal capacity
    of the vessel.</p>

    <p>A Recipe for Re-inking Purple Type Ribbons.&mdash;Use:
    Aniline violet, 1/4 ounce; pure alcohol, 15 ounces;
    concentrated glycerine, 15 ounces. Dissolve the aniline in the
    alcohol, and add the glycerine.</p>

    <p>The Process of Giving a Tempered-Blue Color to the Steel
    Plate and Malleable Iron Castings of a Roller Skate.&mdash;In
    order to obtain an even blue, the work must have an even
    finish, and be made perfectly clean. Arrange a cast-iron pot in
    a fire so as to heat it to the temperature of melted lead, or
    just below a red heat. Make a flat bottom basket of wire or
    wire cloth to sit in the iron box, on which place the work to
    be blued, as many pieces as you may find you can manage, always
    putting in pieces of about the same thickness and size, so that
    they will heat evenly. Make a bail to the basket, so that it
    can be easily handled. When the desired color is obtained, dip
    quickly in hot water to stop the progress of the bluing, for an
    instant only, so that enough heat may be retained to dry the
    articles. A cover to the iron box may sometimes be used to
    advantage to hasten the heating. Another way, much used, is to
    varnish the work with ultramarine varnish, which may be
    obtained from the varnish makers.</p>

    <p>Cement to Mend Iron Pots and Pans.&mdash;Take two parts of
    sulphur and one part, by weight, of fine black lead; put the
    sulphur in an old iron pan, holding it over the fire until it
    begins to melt, then add the lead; stir well until all is mixed
    and melted; then pour out on an iron plate or smooth stone.
    When cool, break into small pieces. A sufficient quantity of
    this compound being placed upon the crack of the iron pot to be
    mended, can be soldered by a hot iron in the same way a
    tinsmith solders his sheets. If there is a small hole in the
    pot, drive a copper rivet in it, and then solder over it with
    this cement. The Best Method of Rendering Basement Walls
    Damp-Proof.&mdash;Construct on the outside an area wall so that
    the earth does not rest directly against the main wall of the
    house, but only against the outside wall or casing of the area.
    To form such an area, build a wall half or one brick thick
    parallel to and some 2 or 3 inches from the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page135"
       id="page135"></a>[pg 135]</span> main wall, and form at the
       bottom a channel or gutter connected with the drains, so
       that any moisture or water finding its way in through the
       outer casing may be conducted away and will not therefore
       penetrate into the building. Thoroughly ventilate the areas
       by means of air bricks or other suitable connections with
       the outer air, and connect with one another by making
       through connections underneath the floor joists. Be very
       careful that the main wall is laid on a good and efficient
       damp course. The top of the space between the area and main
       walls may be covered in all around the building with
       bricks&mdash;ornamented or otherwise, as preferred&mdash;on
       a line just above the ground. Another plan of effecting the
       same object is to dispense with the area wall and in
       building the brick work to cover the whole of the work on
       the outside with a thick layer of bituminous asphalt. The
       plaster on the inside is in this case often rendered in
       nearly neat Portland cement.</p>

    <p>How to Caseharden Large Pieces of Steel.&mdash;A box of cast
    or wrought iron should be provided large enough to hold one or
    two of the pieces, with sufficient room all around to pack well
    with the casehardening materials, which may be leather scrap,
    hoof shavings, or horn shavings, slightly burned and
    pulverized, which may be mixed with an equal quantity of
    pulverized charcoal. Pack the pieces to be casehardened in the
    iron box so as not to touch each other or the box. Put an iron
    cover on the box and lute with clay. Heat gradually in a
    furnace to a full red, keep at an even temperature for from 2
    to 4 hours, raise the heat to a cherry red during the last
    hour, then remove the cover and take out the pieces and plunge
    endwise vertically in water at shop temperature; 2 per cent. of
    hydrochloric acid in the water improves its tempering qualities
    and gives the metal an even gray color.</p>

    <p>A Good and Cheap Preparation to Put on Friction
    Matches.&mdash;The igniting composition varies with different
    makers. The following recipes may be taken as fairly
    representative, the first being the best: 1. Phosphorus by
    weight, 1/2 part; potassium chlorate, 4 parts; glue, 2 parts;
    whiting, 1 part; finely powdered glass, 4 parts; water, 11
    parts. 2. Phosphorus by weight, 2 parts; potassium chlorate, 5
    parts; glue, 3 parts; red lead, 1-1/2 parts; water, 12 parts.
    3. A German mixture for matches. Potassium chlorate, 7.8 parts;
    lead hyposulphite, 2.6 parts; gum arabic, 1 part.</p>

    <p>To Find How Much Tin Vessels Will Hold.&mdash;For the
    contents of cylinders: Square the diameter, and multiply the
    product by 0.7854. Again, multiply by the height (all in
    inches). Divide the product by 231 for gallons. For the frustum
    of a cone: Add together the squares of the diameters of large
    and small ends; to this add the product of the diameter of the
    two ends. Multiply this sum by 0.7854. Multiply this product by
    the height (all in inches). Then divide by 231 for the number
    of gallons.</p>

    <p>A Useful Recipe.&mdash;For stopping the joints between
    slates or shingles, etc., and chimneys, doors, windows, etc., a
    mixture of stiff white-lead paint, with sand enough to prevent
    it from running, is very good, especially if protected by a
    covering of strips of lead or copper, tin, etc., nailed to the
    mortar joints of the chimneys, after being bent so as to enter
    said joints, which should be scraped out for an inch in depth,
    and afterward refilled. Mortar protected in the same way, or
    even unprotected, is often used for the purpose, but it is not
    equal to the paint and sand. Mortar a few days old (to allow
    refractory particles of lime to slack), mixed with blacksmith's
    cinders and molasses, is much used for this purpose, and
    becomes very hard and effective.</p>

    <p>Test for Hard or Soft Water.&mdash;Dissolve a small quantity
    of good soap in alcohol. Let a few drops fall into a glass of
    water. If it turns milky, it is hard; if not, it is soft.</p>

    <p>Test for Earthy Matters or Alkali in Water.&mdash;Take
    litmus paper dipped in vinegar, and if, on immersion, the paper
    returns to its true shade, the water does not contain earthy
    matter or alkali. If a few drops of syrup be added to a water
    containing an earthy matter, it will turn green.</p>

    <p>Test for Carbonic Acid in Water.&mdash;Take equal parts of
    water and clear lime water. If combined or free carbonic acid
    is present, a precipitate is seen, to which, if a few drops of
    muriatic acid be added, an effervescence commences.</p>

    <p>Test for Magnesia in Water.&mdash;Boil the water to a
    twentieth part of its weight, and then drop a few grains of
    neutral carbonate of ammonia into a glass of it, and a few
    drops of phosphate of soda. If magnesia be present, it will
    fall to the bottom.</p>

    <p>Test for Iron in Water.&mdash;1. Boil a little nutgall and
    add to the water. If it turns gray or slate, black iron is
    present. 2. Dissolve a little prussiate of potash, and, if iron
    is present, it will turn blue.</p>

    <p>Test for Lime in Water.&mdash;Into a glass of water put two
    drops of oxalic acid and blow upon it. If it gets milky, lime
    is present.</p>

    <p>Test for Acid in Water.&mdash;Take a piece of litmus paper.
    If it turns red, there must be acid. If it precipitates on
    adding lime water, it is carbonic acid. If a blue sugar paper
    is turned red, it is a mineral acid.</p>

    <p>Value of Manufactured Steel.&mdash;A pound of very fine
    steel wire to make watch springs of, is worth about $4; this
    will make 17,000 springs, worth $7,000.</p>

    <p>Horses in Norway have a very sensible way of taking their
    food, which perhaps might be beneficially followed here. They
    have a bucket of water put down beside their allowance of hay.
    It is interesting to see with what relish they take a sip of
    the one and a mouthful of the other alternately, sometimes only
    moistening their mouths, as a rational being would do while
    eating a dinner of such dry food. A broken-winded horse is
    scarcely ever seen in Norway, and the question is if the mode
    of feeding has not something to do with the preservation of the
    animal's respiratory organs.</p>

    <p>The Process of Fastening Rubber Rolls on Clothes
    Wringer.&mdash;1. Clean shaft thoroughly between the shoulders
    or washers, where the rubber goes on, 2. Give the shaft a coat
    of copal varnish, between the shoulders, and let it dry. 3.
    Give shaft coat of varnish and wind shaft tightly as possible
    with five-ply jute twine at once, while varnish is green, and
    let it dry for about six hours. 4. Give shaft over the twine a
    coat of rubber cement, and let it dry for about six hours. 5.
    Give shaft over the twine a second coat of rubber cement, and
    let it dry for about six hours. 6. Remove washer on the short
    end of shaft, also the cogwheel if the shaft has cogs on both
    ends. 7. See that the rubber rolls are always longer than the
    space between the washers where the rubber goes on, as they
    shrink or take up a little in putting on the shaft. 8. Clean
    out the hole or inside of roll with benzine, using a small
    brush or swab. 9. Put the thimble or pointer on the end of
    shaft that the washer has been removed from, and give shaft
    over the twine and thimble another coat of cement, and stand
    same upright in a vise. 10. Give the inside or hole of roll a
    coat of cement with a small rod or stick. 11. Pull or force the
    roll on the shaft as quickly as possible with a jerk, then
    rivet the washer on with a cold chisel.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"
       id="page136"></a>[pg 136]</span> 12. Let roll stand and get
       dry for two or three days before using same. Cement for use
       should be so thick that it will run freely; if it gets too
       thick, thin it with benzine or naphtha.</p>

    <p>How to Make Effervescing Solution of Citrate of
    Magnesia.&mdash;Dissolve citric acid 400 grains in water 2,000
    grains, add carbonate of magnesia 200 grains; stir until
    dissolved. Filter into a 12-ounce bottle containing syrup of
    citric acid 1,200 grains. Add boiled and filtered water to fill
    bottle, drop in bicarbonate of potash in crystals 30 grains and
    immediately cork. Shake until bicarbonate of potash is
    dissolved. The syrup of citric acid is made from citric acid 8
    parts, water 8 parts, spirit of lemon 4 parts, syrup 980
    parts.</p>

    <p>A Receipt for Making the Black Cement that is Used for
    Filling Letters after They are Cut out in Brass.&mdash;Mix
    asphaltum, brown japan and lampblack into a putty-like mass,
    fill in the spaces, and finally clean the edges with
    turpentine.</p>

    <p>Useful Workshop Hints.&mdash;Clean and oil leather belts
    without taking them off their pulleys. If taken off they will
    shrink. Then a piece must be put into them and removed again
    after the belt has run a few days. The decay of stone, either
    in buildings or monuments, may be arrested by heating and
    treating with paraffin mixed with a little creosote. A common
    "paint burner" may be used to heat the stone. Set an engine
    upon three or four movable points, as upon three cannon balls.
    Connect with steam, and exhaust by means of rubber hose. If the
    engine will run up to speed without moving itself back and
    forth, then that engine will run a long time with little
    repair. If it shakes itself around the room, then buy another
    engine. Safely moving a tall mill chimney has been accomplished
    several times. Chimneys which have been caused to lean slightly
    through settling of the foundation may be straightened up again
    by sawing out the mortar between courses of brick at the base.
    A chimney 100 ft. high and 12 ft. square at the base will be
    varied over 8 in. at the top by the removal of 1 in. at the
    base. When you begin to fix up the mill for cold weather, don't
    forget to put a steam trap in each and every steam pipe which
    can be opened into the atmosphere for heating purposes. For
    leading steam joints, mix the red lead or litharge with common
    commercial glycerine, instead of linseed oil. Put a little
    carbolic acid in your glue or paste pot. It will keep the
    contents sweet for a long time. Look well to the bearings of
    your shafting engine and machines. Sometimes 25, 30, 40 and
    even 50 per cent. of your power is consumed through lack of
    good oil. When you buy a water wheel, be sure to buy one small
    enough to run at full gate while the stream is low during the
    summer months. If you want more power than the small wheel will
    give, then put in two or more wheels of various sizes. When it
    becomes necessary to trim a piece of rubber, it will be found
    that the knife will cut much more readily if dipped in water.
    When forging a chisel or other cutting tool, never upset the
    end of the tool. If necessary cut it off, but don't try to
    force it back into a good cutting edge. In tubular boilers the
    handholes should be often opened, and all collections removed
    from over the fire. When boilers are fed in front, and are
    blown off through the same pipe, the collection of mud or
    sediment in the rear end should be often removed. Nearly all
    smoke may be consumed without special apparatus, by attending
    with a little common sense to a few simple rules. Suppose we
    have a battery of boilers, and "soft coal" is the fuel. Go to
    the first boiler, shut the damper nearly up, and fire up
    one-half of the furnace, close the door, open damper, and go to
    the next boiler and repeat the firing. By this method nearly,
    if not quite, all the smoke will be consumed. A coiled spring
    inserted between engine and machinery is highly beneficial
    where extreme regularity of power is required. It is well known
    that a steam engine, in order to govern itself, must run too
    fast and too slow in order to close or open its valves; hence
    an irregularity of power is unavoidable.</p>

    <p>A "Paste" Metal Polish for Cleaning and Polishing
    Brass.&mdash;Oxalic acid 1 part, iron peroxide 15 parts,
    powdered rottenstone 20 parts, palm oil 60 parts, petrolatum 4
    parts. See that solids are thoroughly pulverized and sifted,
    then add and thoroughly incorporate oil and petrolatum.</p>

    <p>Cough Candy or Troches.&mdash;Tincture of squills 2 ounces,
    camphorated tincture of opium and tincture of tolu of each 1/4
    ounce, wine of ipecac 1/2 ounce, oil of gautheria 4 drops,
    sassafras 3 drops, and of anise seed oil 2 drops. The above
    mixture is to be put into 5 pounds of candy which is just ready
    to take from the fire; continue the boiling a little longer, so
    as to form into sticks.</p>

    <p>How to Oxidize Silver.&mdash;For this purpose a pint of
    sulphide of potassium, made by intimately mixing and heating
    together 2 parts of thoroughly dried potash and 1 part of
    sulphur powder, is used. Dissolve 2 to 3 drachms of this
    compound in 1-3/4 pints of water, and bring the liquid to a
    temperature of from 155 degrees to 175 degrees Fah., when it is
    ready for use. Silver objects, previously freed from dust and
    grease with soda lye and thorough rinsing in water, plunged
    into this bath are instantly covered with an iridescent film of
    silver sulphide, which in a few seconds more becomes blue
    black. The objects are then removed, rinsed off in plenty of
    fresh water, scratch brushed, and if necessary polished.</p>

    <p>Useful Household Recipes.&mdash;To purify water in glass
    vessels and aquariums, it is recommended to add to every 100
    grammes of water four drops of a solution of one gramme of
    salicylic acid in 300 grammes of water. The <i>Norsk
    Fiskeritidende</i>, published at Bergen, Norway, says that
    thereby the water may be kept fresh for three months without
    being renewed. A cement recommended as something which can
    hardly be picked to pieces is made as follows:&mdash;Mix equal
    parts of lime and brown sugar with water, and be sure the lime
    is thoroughly air-slacked. This mortar is equal to Portland
    cement, and is of extraordinary strength. For a few weeks'
    preservation of organic objects in their original form,
    dimensions and color, Professor Grawitz recommends a mixture
    composed of two and a half ounces of chloride of sodium, two
    and three-quarters drachms of saltpetre, and one pint of water,
    to which is to be added three per cent. of boric acid. To
    varnish chromos, take equal quantities of linseed oil and oil
    of turpentine; thicken by exposure to the sun and air until it
    becomes resinous and half evaporated; then add a portion of
    melted beeswax. Varnishing pictures should always be performed
    in fair weather, and out of any current of cold or damp air. A
    fireproof whitewash can be readily made by adding one part
    silicate of soda (or potash) to every five parts of whitewash.
    The addition of a solution of alum to whitewash is recommended
    as a means to prevent the rubbing off of the wash. A coating of
    a good glue size made by dissolving half a pound of glue in a
    gallon of water is employed when the wall is to be papered. The
    most nourishing steam bath that can be applied to a person who
    is unable to sweat and can take but little food in the
    stomach:&mdash;Produce the sweating by burning alcohol under a
    chair in which the person sits, with blanket covering to hold
    the heat. Use caution and but little alcohol. Fire it in a
    shallow iron pan or old saucer.</p>

    <p>Own Your Own Homes.&mdash;Every man, whether he is a working
    man in the common acceptation of the word or not,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"
       id="page137"></a>[pg 137]</span> feels a deep interest in
       the management of the affairs of the city, county and State
       in which he lives whenever he owns a home. He is more
       patriotic, and in many ways is a better citizen than the man
       who simply rents, and who has but little if any assurance of
       how long it will be before he can be ordered to move; to
       which may be added in many cases the saving of more money.
       Of course it requires some economy to lay up a sufficient
       amount of money to purchase and pay for a home; but this
       very fact, if properly carried out after the home is
       acquired, may be the instrument of furnishing the means to
       commence and prosecute a business upon your own
       responsibility. True, in some cases it will require more
       economy, perhaps, than we are now practicing. But the
       question with every man, and especially if he is the head of
       a family, is, Can he afford it? That is, can he afford to
       live up his wages as fast as he earns them, without laying
       up anything for the future? If he is the head of a family,
       he is obliged to pay rent, and it does not require very many
       years of rent paying to make up an amount sufficient to
       purchase and pay for a comfortable home. You have to pay the
       rent. This you say you cannot avoid and be honest. Well, you
       cannot be honest with your family unless you make a
       reasonable attempt to provide them a home of their own in
       case anything should happen to you. And the obligation to do
       this should be as strong as the one to pay rent or provide
       the other necessaries for the comfort of your family. When
       you own a home you feel a direct interest in public affairs
       that otherwise you might consider were of little
       interest.</p>

    <p>A Formula for Nervous Headache.&mdash;Alcohol dilut., 4
    ounces; Olei cinnamon, 4 minims; Potas. bromid., 5 drachms;
    Extr. hyoscyam., fl., 1-1/2 drachms; Fiat lotio. One to two
    teaspoonfuls, if required.</p>

    <p>How Beeswax is Refined and Made Nice and Yellow.&mdash;Pure
    white wax is obtained from the ordinary beeswax by exposure to
    the influence of the sun and weather. The wax is sliced into
    thin flakes and laid on sacking or coarse cloth, stretched on
    frames, resting on posts to raise them from the ground. The wax
    is turned over frequently and occasionally sprinkled with soft
    water if there be not dew and rain sufficient to moisten it.
    The wax should be bleached in about four weeks. If, on breaking
    the flakes, the wax still appears yellow inside, it is
    necessary to melt it again and flake and expose it a second
    time, or even oftener, before it becomes thoroughly bleached,
    the time required being mainly dependent upon the weather.
    There is a preliminary process by which, it is claimed, much
    time is saved in the subsequent bleaching; this consists in
    passing melted wax and steam through long pipes, so as to
    expose the wax as much as possible to the action of the steam;
    thence into a pan heated by a steam bath, where it is stirred
    thoroughly with water and then allowed to settle. The whole
    operation is repeated a second and third time, and the wax is
    then in condition to be more readily bleached.</p>

    <p>How to Remove a Wart From the Hand.&mdash;Take of salicylic
    acid, 30 grains; ext. cannabis indic., 10 grains; collodion,
    1/2 ounce. Mix and apply.</p>

    <p>Recipe for Making Camphor Ice in Small Quantities for Home
    Use.&mdash;Melt together over a water bath white wax and
    spermaceti, each 1 ounce; camphor, 2 ounces, in sweet almond
    oil, 1 pound; then triturate until the mixture has become
    homogeneous, and allow one pound of rosewater to flow in slowly
    during the operation.</p>

    <p>Recipe for Making Instantaneous Ink and Stain
    Extractor.&mdash;Take of chloride of lime 1 pound, thoroughly
    pulverized, and four quarts soft water. The foregoing must be
    thoroughly shaken when first put together. It is required to
    stand twenty-four hours to dissolve the chloride of lime; then
    strain through a cotton cloth, after which add a teaspoonful of
    acetic acid to every ounce of the chloride of lime water.</p>

    <p>Removing Paint Spots From Wood.&mdash;To take spots of paint
    off wood, lay a thick coating of lime and soda mixed together
    over it, letting it stay twenty-four hours; then wash off with
    warm water, and the spot will have disappeared.</p>

    <p>Polishing Plate Glass.&mdash;To polish plate glass and
    remove slight scratches, rub the surface gently, first with a
    clean pad of fine cotton wool, and afterwards with a similar
    pad covered over with cotton velvet which has been charged with
    fine rouge. The surface will acquire a polish of great
    brilliancy, quite free from any scratches.</p>

    <p>Recipe for a Good Condition Powder.&mdash;Ground ginger 1
    pound, antimony sulphide 1 pound, powdered sulphur 1 pound,
    saltpetre. Mix altogether and administer in a mash, in such
    quantities as may be required.</p>

    <p>Recipe to Make Violet Ink.&mdash;Ordinary aniline violet
    soluble in water, with a little alcohol and glycerine, makes an
    excellent ink.</p>

    <p>Recipe to Make Good Shaving Soap.&mdash;Either 66 pounds
    tallow and 34 pounds cocoanut oil, or 33 pounds of tallow and
    the same quantity of palm oil and 34 pounds cocoanut oil,
    treated by the cold process, with 120 pounds caustic soda lye
    of 27 deg. Baume, will make 214 pounds of shaving soap.</p>

    <p>How to Make a Starch Enamel for Stiffening Collars, Cuffs,
    etc.&mdash;Use a little gum arabic thoroughly dissolved in the
    starch.</p>

    <p>A Good Cough Syrup.&mdash;Put 1 quart hoarhound to 1 quart
    water, and boil it down to a pint; add two or three sticks of
    licorice and a tablespoonful of essence of lemon. The Cause of
    the Disease Called "Hives," also Its Cure.&mdash;The trouble is
    caused by a perversion of the digestive functions, accompanied
    by a disturbance of the circulation. It is not attended with
    danger, and is of importance only from the annoyance which it
    causes. Relief may be obtained in most instances by the use of
    cream tartar daily to such extent as to move the bowels
    slightly. Make a strong solution, sweeten it pleasantly, and
    take a teaspoonful, say after each meal, until the effect above
    mentioned is produced, and continue the treatment until the
    hives cease to be troublesome.</p>

    <p>A Bedbug Poison.&mdash;Set in the center of the room a dish
    containing 4 ounces of brimstone. Light it, and close the room
    as tight as possible, stopping the keyhole of the door with
    paper to keep the fumes of the brimstone in the room. Let it
    remain for three or four hours, then open the windows and air
    thoroughly. The brimstone will be found to have also bleached
    the paint, if it was a yellowish white. Mixtures such as equal
    parts of turpentine and kerosene oil are used; filling up the
    cracks with hard soap is an excellent remedy. Benzine and
    gasoline will kill bedbugs as fast as they can reach them. A
    weak solution of zinc chloride is also said to be an effectual
    banisher of these pests.</p>

    <p>A Preparation by Which You can Take a Natural Flower and Dip
    It in, That Will Preserve It.&mdash;Dip the flowers in melted
    paraffine, withdrawing them quickly. The liquid should only be
    just hot enough to maintain its fluidity and the flowers should
    be dipped one at a time, held by the stalks, and moved about
    for an instant to get rid of air bubbles. Fresh cut specimens
    free from moisture make excellent specimens in this way.</p>

    <p>What Causes Shaking Asp Leaves to be always in a
    Quiver?&mdash;The wind or vibration of the air only causes the
    quiver of the aspen
    leaf.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"
       id="page138"></a>[pg 138]</span>

    <p>What "Sozodont" is Composed of.&mdash;Potassium carbonate,
    1/2 ounce; honey, 4 ounces; alcohol, 2 ounces; water, 10
    ounces; oil of wintergreen and oil of rose, to flavor,
    sufficient.</p>

    <p>What is Used to Measure Cold below 35 Degrees
    Fahrenheit?&mdash;Metallic thermometers are used to measure
    lowest temperatures, alcohol being quite irregular.</p>

    <p>Is the Top Surface of Ice on a Pond, the Amount of Water let
    in and out being the Same Day by Day, on a Level with the Water
    Surface or above it?&mdash;Ice is slightly elastic, and when
    fast to the shore the central portion rises and falls with
    slight variations in water level, the proportion above and
    below water level being as is the weight of ice to the weight
    of water it displaces.</p>

    <p>Of the Two Waters, Hard and Soft, Which Freezes the Quicker;
    and in ice Which Saves the Best in Like Packing?&mdash;Soft
    water freezes the quickest and keeps the best.</p>

    <p>Does Water in Freezing Purify Itself?&mdash;It clears itself
    from chemicals; does not clear itself from mechanical mixtures
    as mud and clay.</p>

    <p>A Receipt to Remove Freckles from the Face without Injury to
    the Skin.&mdash;A commonly used preparation for this purpose
    is: Sulpho-carbolate of zinc, 2 parts; distilled glycerine, 25
    parts; rose water, 25 parts; scented alcohol, 5 parts. To be
    applied twice daily for from half an hour to an hour, and then
    washed off with cold water.</p>

    <p>What will Remove Warts Painlessly?&mdash;Touch the wart with
    a little nitrate of silver, or with nitric acid, or with
    aromatic vinegar. The silver salt will produce a black, and the
    nitric acid a yellow stain, either of which will wear off in a
    short while. The vinegar scarcely discolors the skin. A Good
    Receipt to Prevent Hair Coming Out.&mdash;Scald black tea, 2
    ounces, with I gallon of boiling water, strain and add 3 ounces
    glycerine, tincture cantharides 1/2 ounce, bay rum 1 quart. Mix
    well and perfume. This is a good preparation for frequent use
    in its effect both on the scalp and hair, but neither will be
    kept in good condition without care and attention to general
    health.</p>

    <p>Deaths from Diphtheria per 100,000 Inhabitants in the Chief
    Cities of the World.&mdash;Amsterdam, 265; Berlin, 245; Madrid,
    225; Dresden, 184; Warsaw, 167; Philadelphia, 163; Chicago,
    146; Turin, 127; St. Petersburg, 121; Bucharest, 118; Berne,
    115; Munich, 111; Stockholm, 107; Malines, 105; Antwerp, 104;
    New York, 91; Paris, 85; Hamburg, 76; Naples, 74; Lisbon, 74;
    Stuttgart, 61; Rome, 56; Edinburgh, 50; Buda-Pesth, 50; The
    Hague, 45; Vienna, 44; London, 44; Christiania, 43; Copenhagen,
    42; Suburbs of Brussels, 36; City of Brussels, 35.</p>

    <p>A Receipt for Marshmallows, as Made by
    Confectioners.&mdash;Dissolve one-half pound of gum arabic in
    one pint of water, strain, and add one-half pound of fine
    sugar, and place over the fire, stirring constantly until the
    syrup is dissolved, and all of the consistency of honey. Add
    gradually the whites of four eggs well beaten. Stir the mixture
    until it becomes somewhat thin and does not adhere to the
    finger. Flavor to taste, and pour into a tin slightly dusted
    with powdered starch, and when cool divide into small
    squares.</p>

    <p>A Receipt for Making Compressed Yeast.&mdash;This yeast is
    obtained by straining the common yeast in breweries and
    distilleries until a moist mass is obtained, which is then
    placed in hair bags, and the rest of the water pressed out
    until the mass is nearly dry. It is then sewed up in strong
    linen bags for transportation.</p>

    <p>How to Tell the Age of Eggs.&mdash;We recommend the
    following process (which has been known for some time, but has
    been forgotten) for finding out the age of eggs, and
    distinguishing those that are fresh from those that are not.
    This method is based upon the decrease in the density of eggs
    as they grow old. Dissolve two ounces of kitchen salt in a pint
    of water. When a fresh-laid egg is placed in this solution it
    will descend to the bottom of the vessel, while one that has
    been laid on the day previous will not quite reach the bottom.
    If the egg be three days old it will swim in the liquid, and if
    it is more than three days old it will float on the surface,
    and project above the latter more and more in proportion as it
    is older.</p>

    <p>A Recipe for Making Court Plaster.&mdash;Isinglass 125
    grains, alcohol 1-3/4 fluid ounces, glycerine 12 minims, water
    and tincture of benzoin each sufficient quantity. Dissolve the
    isinglass in enough water to make the solution weigh four fluid
    ounces. Spread half of the latter with a brush upon successive
    layers of taffeta, waiting after each application until the
    layer is dry. Mix the second half of the isinglass solution
    with the alcohol and glycerine, and apply in the same manner.
    Then reverse the taffeta, coat it on the back with tincture of
    benzoin, and allow it to become perfectly dry. There are many
    other formulas, but this is official. The above quantities are
    sufficient to make a piece of court plaster fifteen inches
    square.</p>

    <p>One of the Very Best Scouring Pastes Consists
    of&mdash;Oxalic acid, 1 part; Iron peroxide, 15 parts; Powdered
    rottenstone, 20 parts; Palm oil, 60 parts; Petrolatum, 4 parts.
    Pulverize the oxalic acid and add rouge and rottenstone, mixing
    thoroughly, and sift to remove all grit; then add gradually the
    palm oil and petrolatum, incorporating thoroughly. Add oil of
    myrbane, or oil of lavender to suit. By substituting your red
    ashes from stove coal, an inferior representative of the
    foregoing paste will be produced.</p>

    <p>How to Manufacture Worcestershire Sauce.&mdash;A. Mix
    together 1-1/2 gallons white wine vinegar, 1 gallon walnut
    catsup, 1 gallon mushroom catsup, 1/2 gallon Madeira wine, 1/2
    gallon Canton soy, 2-1/2 pounds moist sugar, 19 ounces salt, 3
    ounces powdered capsicum, 1-1/2 ounces each of pimento and
    coriander, 1-1/2 ounces chutney, 3/4 ounce each of cloves, mace
    and cinnamon, and 6-1/2 drachms assafoetida dissolved in pint
    brandy 20 above proof. Boil 2 pounds hog's liver for twelve
    hours in 1 gallon of water, adding water as required to keep up
    the quantity, then mix the boiled liver thoroughly with the
    water, strain it through a coarse sieve. Add this to the
    sauce.</p>

    <p>A Good Receipt for Making Honey, Without Using Honey as One
    of the Ingredients,&mdash;5 lbs. white sugar, 2 lbs. water,
    gradually bring to a boil, and skim well. When cool add 1 lb.
    bees' honey, and 4 drops peppermint. To make of better quality
    add less water and more real honey.</p>

    <p>What the Chemical Composition of Honey is.&mdash;Principally
    of saccharine matter and water, about as follows: Levulose
    33-1/2 to 40 per cent., dextrose 31-3/4 to 39 per cent., water
    20 to 30 per cent., besides ash and other minor
    constituents.</p>

    <p>How to Clean Carpets on the Floor to Make Them Look
    Bright.&mdash;To a pailful of water add three pints of oxgall,
    wash the carpet with this until a lather is produced, which is
    washed off with clean water.</p>

    <p>How to Take Out Varnish Spots from Cloth.&mdash;Use
    chloroform or benzine, and as a last resource spirits of
    turpentine, followed after drying by benzine.</p>

    <p>Flour Paste for all Purposes.&mdash;Mix 1 pound rye flour in
    lukewarm water, to which has been added one teaspoonful of
    pulverized alum; stir until free of lumps. Boil in the regular
    way, or slowly pour on boiling water, stirring all the time
    until the paste becomes stiff. When cold add a full quarter
    pound of common strained honey, mix well (regular bee honey, no
    patent mixture).</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"
       id="page139"></a>[pg 139]</span>

    <p>How to Make Liquid Glue.&mdash;Take a wide mouthed bottle,
    and dissolve in it 8 ounces beet glue in 1/2 pint water, by
    setting it in a vessel of water, and heating until dissolved.
    Then add slowly 2-1/2 ounces strong nitric acid 36 deg. Baume,
    stirring all the while. Effervescence takes place, with
    generation of fumes. When all the acid has been added, the
    liquid is allowed to cool. Keep it well corked, and it will be
    ready for use at any time.</p>

    <p>How the World is Weighed and Its Density and Mass
    Computed.&mdash;The density, mass, or weight of the earth was
    found by the observed force of attraction of a known mass of
    lead or iron for another mass; or of a mountain by the
    deflection of a torsion thread or plumb line. In this manner
    the mean density of the earth has been found to be from 4.71 to
    6.56 times the weight of water, 5.66 being accredited as the
    most reliable. The weight of a cubic foot of water being known,
    and the contents of the earth being computed in cubic feet, we
    have but to multiply the number of cubic feet by 5.66 times the
    weight of 1 cubic foot of water to obtain the weight of the
    earth in pounds, or units of gravity at its surface, which is
    the unit usually used. Another method of determining the mean
    density of the earth is founded on the change of the intensity
    of gravity in descending deep mines.</p>

    <p>A Theory as to the Origin of Petroleum.&mdash;Professor
    Mendelejef has recently advanced the theory that petroleum is
    of purely mineral origin and that the formation of it is going
    on every day. He has, moreover, succeeded in producing
    artificial petroleum by a reaction that he describes, and he
    states that it is impossible to detect any difference between
    the natural product and the manufactured article. His theory is
    as follows: <ins class="correction"
         title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'Infilration'.">
    Infiltration</ins> of water, reaching a certain depth, come
    into contact with incandescent masses of carburets of metals,
    chiefly of iron, and are at once decomposed into oxygen and
    hydrogen. The oxygen unites with the iron, while the hydrogen
    seizes on the carbon and rises to an upper level, where the
    vapors are condensed in part into mineral oil, and the rest
    remains in a state of natural gas. The petroleum strata are
    generally met with in the vicinity of mountains, and it may be
    granted that geological upheavals have dislocated the ground in
    such a way as to permit of the <ins class="correction"
         title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'admistoin'.">
    admission</ins> of water to great depths. If the center of the
    earth contains great masses of metallic carburets, we may, in
    case this theory is verified, count upon an almost
    inexhaustible source of fuel for the day when our coal deposits
    shall fail us.</p>

    <p>How Vaseline is Purified.&mdash;The residuum from which
    vaseline is made is placed in settling tanks heated by steam,
    in order to keep their contents in a liquid state. After the
    complete separation of the fine coke it is withdrawn from these
    tanks and passed through the bone black cylinders, during which
    process the color is nearly all removed, as well as its
    empyreumatic odor.</p>

    <p>The Latest and Best Process Employed by Cutters and Others
    in Etching Names and Designs on Steel.&mdash;Take copper
    sulphate, sulphate of alum and sodium chloride, of each 2
    drachms, and strong acetic acid 1-1/2 ounces, mixed together.
    Smear the metal with yellow soap and write with a quill pen
    without a split.</p>

    <p>The History of the Discovery of Circulation of the Blood
    recapitulated, divides itself naturally into a series of
    epoch-making periods: 1. The structure and functions of the
    valves of the heart, Erasistratus, B.C. 304. 2. The arteries
    carry blood during life, not air, Galen, A.D. 165. 3. The
    pulmonary circulation, Servetus, 1553. 4. The systemic
    circulation, C&aelig;salpinus, 1593. 5. The pulmonic and
    systemic circulations, Harvey, 1628. 6. The capillaries,
    Malpighi, 1661.</p>

    <p>How to Make Hand Fire Grenades.&mdash;Make your hand
    grenades. Fill ordinary quart wine bottles with a saturated
    solution of common salt, and place them where they will do the
    most good in case of need. They will be found nearly as
    serviceable as the expensive hand grenades you buy. Should a
    fire break out, throw them with force sufficient to break them
    into the center of the fire. The salt will form a coating on
    whatever object the water touches, and make it nearly
    incombustible, and it will prove effectual in many cases, where
    a fire is just starting, when the delay in procuring water
    might be fatal.</p>

    <p>How the Kind of White Metal is Made That is Used in the
    Manufacture of Cheap Table Ware.&mdash;How same can be hardened
    and still retain its color? The following are formulas for
    white metal. Melt together: (<i>a</i>) Tin 82, lead 18,
    antimony 5, zinc 1, copper 4 parts. (<i>b</i>) Brass 32, lead
    2, tin 2, zinc 1 part. For a hard metal, not so white, melt
    together bismuth 6 parts, zinc 3 parts, lead 13 parts. Or use
    type metal&mdash;lead 3 to 7 parts, antimony 1 part.</p>

    <p>What Metal Expands Most, for the Same Change in
    Temperature?&mdash;For one degree Centigrade the following are
    coefficients of linear expansion: aluminum, 0.0000222; silver,
    0.0000191 to 0.0000212; nickel. 0.0000128; copper, 0.0000167 to
    0.0000178; zinc, 0.0000220 to 0.0000292; brass, 0.0000178 to
    0.0000193; platinum, 0.0000088.</p>

    <p>Heavy Timbers.&mdash;There are sixteen species of trees in
    America, whose perfectly dry wood will sink in water. The
    heaviest of these is the black iron wood (confalia feriea) of
    Southern Florida, which is more than 30 per cent. heavier than
    water. Of the others, the best known are lignum vit&aelig;
    (gualacum sanctum) and mangrove (chizphora mangle). Another is
    a small oak (quercus gsisea) found in the mountains of Texas,
    Southern New Mexico and Arizona, and westward to the Colorado
    desert, at an elevation of 5,000 to 10,000 feet. All the
    species in which the wood is heavier than water belong to
    semi-tropical Florida or the arid interior Pacific region.</p>

    <p>Highest Point Reached by Man was by balloon 27,000 feet.
    Travelers have rarely exceeded 20,000 feet, at which point the
    air from its rarity is very debilitating.</p>

    <p>Has a Rate of Speed Equal to Ninety Miles an Hour, ever Been
    Attained by Railroad Locomotive?&mdash;It is extremely doubtful
    if any locomotive ever made so high a speed. A mile in 48
    seconds is the shortest time we have heard of. A rate of 70 to
    75 miles per hour has been made on a spurt, on good straight
    track. The Grant Locomotive Works could make such an engine.
    Sixty miles an hour for a train is considered a very high rate
    of speed, and is seldom attained in practice for more than a
    short run.</p>

    <p>The Fastest Boat in the World.&mdash;Messrs. Thornycroft
    &amp; Co., of Chiswick, in making preliminary trials of a
    torpedo boat built by them for the Spanish navy, have obtained
    a speed which is worthy of special record. The boat is
    twin-screw, and the principal dimensions are: Length 147 ft. 6
    in., beam 14 ft. 6 in., by 4 ft. 9 in. draught. On a trial at
    Lower Hope, on April 27, the remarkable mean speed of 26.11
    knots was attained, being equal to a speed of 30.06 miles an
    hour, which is the highest speed yet attained by any vessel
    afloat.</p>

    <p>Staining and Polishing Mahogany.&mdash;Your best plan will
    be to scrape off all the old polish, and well glass paper; then
    oil with linseed oil both old and new parts. To stain the new
    pieces, get half an ounce of bichromate of potash, and pour a
    pint of boiling water over it; when cold bottle it. This, used
    with care, will stain the new or light parts as dark as you
    please, if done as follows:&mdash;wipe off the oil clean, and
    apply the solution with a piece of rag, held firmly in the
    hand, and just moistened with the stain. Great care is required
    to prevent the stain running over
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page140"
       id="page140"></a>[pg 140]</span> the old part, for any place
       touched with it will show the mark through the polish when
       finished. You can vary the color by giving two or more coats
       if required. Then repolish your job altogether in the usual
       way. Should you wish to brighten up the old mahogany, use
       polish dyed with Bismarck brown as follows:&mdash;Get three
       pennyworth of Bismarck brown, and put it into a bottle with
       enough naphtha or methylated spirits to dissolve it. Pour a
       few drops of this into your polish, and you will find that
       it gives a nice rich red color to the work, but don't dye
       the polish too much, just tint it.</p>

    <p>Value of Eggs for Food and Other Purposes.&mdash;Every
    element that is necessary to the support of man is contained
    within the limits of an egg shell, in the best proportions and
    in the most palatable form. Plain boiled, they are wholesome.
    It is easy to dress them in more than 500 different ways, each
    method not only economical, but salutary in the highest degree.
    No honest appetite ever yet rejected an egg in some guise. It
    is nutriment in the most portable form, and in the most
    concentrated shape. Whole nations of mankind rarely touch any
    other animal food. Kings eat them plain as readily as do the
    humble tradesmen. After the victory of Muhldorf, when the
    Kaiser Ludwig sat at a meal with his burggrafs and great
    captains, he determined on a piece of luxury&mdash;"one egg to
    every man, and two to the excellently valiant Schwepperman."
    Far more than fish&mdash;for it is watery diet&mdash;eggs are
    the scholar's fare. They contain phosphorus, which is brain
    food, and sulphur, which performs a variety of functions in the
    economy. And they are the best of nutriment for children, for,
    in a compact form, they contain everything that is necessary
    for the growth of the youthful frame. Eggs are, however, not
    only food&mdash;they are medicine also. The white is the most
    efficacious of remedies for burns, and the oil extractable from
    the yolk is regarded by the Russians as an almost miraculous
    salve for cuts, bruises and scratches. A raw egg, if swallowed
    in time, will effectually detach a fish bone fastened in the
    throat, and the white of two eggs will render the deadly
    corrosive sublimate as harmless as a dose of calomel. They
    strengthen the consumptive, invigorate the feeble, and render
    the most susceptible all but proof against jaundice in its more
    malignant phase. They can also be drunk in the shape of that
    "egg flip" which sustains the oratorical efforts of modern
    statesmen. The merits of eggs do not even end here. In France
    alone the wine clarifiers use more than 80,000,000 a year, and
    the Alsatians consume fully 38,000,000 in calico printing and
    for dressing the leather used in making the finest of French
    kid gloves. Finally, not to mention various other employments
    for eggs in the arts, they may, of course, almost without
    trouble on the farmer's part, be converted in fowls, which, in
    any shape, are profitable to the seller and welcome to the
    buyer. Even egg shells are valuable, for aliopath and homeopath
    alike agree in regarding them as the purest of carbonate of
    lime.</p>

    <p>History of Big Ships.&mdash;In the history of mankind
    several vessels of extraordinary magnitude have been
    constructed, all distinctively styled great, and all
    unfortunately disastrous, with the honorable exception of
    Noah's Ark. Setting aside this antediluvian craft, concerning
    the authenticity of whose dimensions authorities differ, and
    which, if Biblical measures are correct, was inferior in size
    to the vessel of most importance to modern shipowners, the
    great galley, constructed by the great engineer Archimedes for
    the great King Hiero II., of Syracuse, is the first
    illustration. This ship without a name (for history does not
    record one) transcended all wonders of ancient maritime
    construction. It abounded statues and painting, marble and
    mosaic work. It contained a gymnasium, baths, a garden, and
    arbored walks. Its artillery discharged stones of 3 cwt., and
    arrows 18 ft. in length. An Athenian advertising poet, who
    wrote a six-line puff of its glories, received the royal reward
    of six thousand bushels of corn. Literary merit was at a higher
    premium in the year 240 B.C., than it is to-day. The great ship
    of antiquity was found to be too large for the accommodation of
    the Syracusan port, and famine reigning in Egypt, Hiero, the
    charitably disposed, embarked a cargo of ten thousand huge jars
    of salted fish, two million pounds of salted meat, twenty
    thousand bundles of different clothes, filled the hold with
    corn, and consigned her to the seven mouths of the Nile, and
    since she weighed anchor nothing more has been heard of her
    fate. The next great ship worthy of mention is the mythical
    Saracen encountered in the Mediterranean Sea by the crusading
    fleet of Richard Coeur de Lion, Duke of Guienne and King of
    England, which, after much slaughter and damage incident to its
    infidel habit of vomiting Greek fire upon its adversaries, was
    captured and sunk. Next in rotation appears the Great Harry,
    built by Henry VIII., of England, and which careened in harbor
    during the reign of his successor, under similar circumstances
    to those attending the Royal George in 1782&mdash;a
    dispensation that mysteriously appears to overhang a majority
    of the ocean-braving constructions which, in defiance of every
    religious sailor's superstition that the lumber he treads is
    naturally female, are christened by a masculine or neutral
    title. In the year 1769, Mark Isambard Brunel, the Edison of
    his age, as his son was the Ericsson of that following,
    permitted himself to be born at Hacqueville; near Rouen,
    France, went to school, to sea, and into politics; compromised
    himself in the latter profession, and went to America in 1794,
    where he surveyed the canal now connecting Lake Champlain with
    the Hudson River at Albany, N.Y. There he turned architect,
    then returned to Europe, settled, married, and was knighted in
    England. He occupied eighteen years of his life in building an
    unproductive tunnel beneath the river Thames at London;
    invented a method of shuffling cards without using the hands,
    and several of her devices for dispensing with labor, which,
    upon completion, were abandoned from economical motives. On his
    decease, his son and heir, I.K. Brunel, whose practical
    experience in the Thames Tunnel job, where his biographers
    assert he had occasion more than once to save his life by
    swimming, qualified him to tread in his father's shoes, took up
    his trade. Brunel, Jr., having demonstrated by costly
    experiments, to the successful proof, but thorough
    exasperation, of his moneyed backers, that his father's theory
    for employing carbonic acid gas as a motive power was
    practicable enough, but too expensive for anything but the
    dissipation of a millionaire's income, settled down to the
    profession of engineering science, in which he did as well as
    his advantages of education enabled him. Like all men in
    advance of their time, when he considered himself the victim of
    arbitrary capitalists ignoring the bent of his genius, he did
    his best work in accordance with their stipulations. He
    designed the Great Western, the first steamship (paddle-wheel)
    ever built to cross the Atlantic; and the Great Britain, the
    original ocean screw steamer. Flushed with these successes,
    Brunei procured pecuniary support from speculative fools, who,
    dazzled by the glittering statistical array that can be adduced
    in support of any chimerical venture, the inventor's repute,
    and their unbaked experience, imagined that the alluring Orient
    was ready to yield, like over-ripe fruit, to their shadowy
    grasp; and tainted as he evidently was with hereditary mania,
    Brunel resolved to seize the illusionary immortality that he
    fondly imagined to be within his reach.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page141"
       id="page141"></a>[pg 141]</span> There was not much the
       matter with the brain of Brunel, Jr., but that little was
       enough; a competent railroad surveyor, a good bridge
       builder, he needed to be held within bounds when handling
       other people's funds; for the man's ambition would have lead
       him to undertake to bridge the Atlantic. He met with the
       speculators required in this very instance of the
       constructors of the Great Eastern. This monstrous ship has
       been described so often, that it would be a cruelty to our
       readers to inflict the story upon them again.</p>

    <p>Natural Gas the Fuel of the Future.&mdash;The house of the
    near future will have no fireplace, steam pipes, chimneys, or
    flues. Wood, coal oil, and other forms of fuel are about to
    disappear altogether in places having factories. Gas has become
    so cheap that already it is supplanting fuels. A single jet
    fairly heats a small room in cold weather. It is a well known
    fact that gas throws off no smoke, soot, or dirt. In a brazier
    filled with chunks of colored glass, and several jets placed
    beneath, the glass soon became heated sufficiently to
    thoroughly warm a room 10x30 feet in size. This design does
    away with the necessity for chimneys, since there is no smoke;
    the ventilation may be had at the window. The heat may be
    raised or lowered by simply regulating the flow of gas. The
    colored glass gives all the appearance of fire; there are black
    pieces to represent coal, red chunks for flames, yellowish
    white glass for white heat, blue glass for blue flames, and
    hues for all the remaining colors of spectrum. Invention
    already is displacing the present fuels for furnaces and
    cooking ranges and glass, doing away with delay and such
    disagreeable objects as ashes, kindling wood, etc. It has only
    been within the past few years that natural gas has been
    utilized to any extent, in either Pennsylvania, New York or
    Ohio. Yet its existence has been known since the early part of
    the century. As far back as 1821, gas was struck in Fredonia,
    Chautauqua county, N.Y., and was used to illuminate the village
    inn when Lafayette passed through the place some three years
    later. Not a single oil well of the many that have been sunk in
    Pennsylvania has been entirely devoid of gas, but even this
    frequent contact with what now seems destined to be the fuel of
    the future bore no fruit of any importance until within the
    past few years. It had been used in comparatively small
    quantities previous to the fall of 1884, but it was not until
    that time that the fuel gave any indication of the important
    role it was afterward to fill. At first ignored, then
    experimented with, natural gas has been finally so widely
    adopted that to-day, in the single city of Pittsburgh, it
    displaces daily 10,000 tons of coal, and has resulted in
    building cities in Ohio and the removal thereto of the glass
    making industries of the United States. The change from the
    solid to the gaseous fuel has been made so rapidly, and has
    effected such marked results in both the processes of
    manufacture and the product, that it is no exaggeration to say
    that the eyes of the entire industrial world are turned with
    envious admiration upon the cities and neighborhoods blessed
    with so unique and valuable a fuel. The regions in which
    natural gas is found are for the most part coincident with the
    formations producing petroleum. This, however, is not always
    the case; and it is worthy of notice that some districts which
    were but indifferent oil-producers are now famous in gas
    records. The gas driller, therefore, usually confines himself
    to the regions known to have produced oil, but the selection of
    the particular location for a well within these limits appears
    to be eminently fanciful. The more scientific generally select
    a spot either on the anticlinal or synclinal axis of the
    formation, giving preference to the former position. Almost all
    rock formations have some inclination to the horizon, and the
    constant change of this inclination produces a series of waves,
    the crests of which are known as anticlines, and the troughs as
    synclines. Many drillers suppose that the gas seeks the
    anticlines and the oil the synclines, but others, equally
    long-headed, discard entirely all theory of this kind, and
    drill wherever it may be most convenient or where other
    operators have already demonstrated the existence of gas. It
    will surprise many of our readers to know that the divining
    rod, that superstitious relic of the middle ages, is still
    frequently called upon to relieve the operator of the trouble
    of a rational decision. The site having been selected, the
    ordinary oil-drilling outfit is employed to sink a hole of
    about six inches in diameter until the gas is reached. In the
    neighborhood of Pittsburgh, this is usually found at a depth of
    1,300 to 1,500 feet, in what is known as the Third Oil Sand, a
    sandstone of the Devonian period. Where the gas comes from
    originally is an open question. When the driller strikes gas,
    he is not left in any doubt of the event, for if the well be
    one of any strength, the gas manifests itself by sending the
    drill and its attachments into the air, often to a height of a
    hundred feet or more. The most prolific wells are appropriately
    called "roarers." During the progress of the drilling, the well
    is lined with iron piping. Occasionally this is also blown out,
    but as a rule the gas satisfies itself with ejecting the drill.
    When the first rush of gas has thrown everything movable out of
    its way, the workmen can approach, and chain the giant to his
    work. The plant at the well is much simpler than one would
    suppose. An elbow joint connects the projecting end of the well
    piping with a pipe leading to a strong sheet-iron tank. This
    collects the salt water brought up with the gas. Ordinarily,
    about half a barrel accumulates in twenty four hours. A safety
    valve, a pressure indicator, and a blow-off complete the
    outfit. When the pressure exceeds a prescribed limit, the valve
    opens, and the gas escapes into the blow-off. This is usually
    30 feet high or more, and the gas issuing from the top is
    either ignited or permitted to escape into the atmosphere. The
    pipe line leading from the tank to the city is of course placed
    underground. Beyond a little wooden house, the blow-off, and a
    derrick, the gas farms differ little in appearance from those
    producing less valuable crops. The pressure of the gas at the
    wells varies considerably. It is generally between 100 and 325
    pounds. As much as 750 pounds per square inch has been
    measured, and in many cases the actual pressure is even greater
    than this, but, as a rule, it is not permitted to much exceed
    20 atmospheres in any receiver or pipe. The best investment for
    parties of small means that we know of is in town lots in North
    Baltimore, Ohio. It is on the main line of the B. &amp; O.
    Railroad and the center of the oil and natural gas discoveries
    in Ohio. Property is bound to double in value. For further
    information, address, W.A. Rhodes, North Baltimore, Ohio.</p>

    <p>Hints on House Building.&mdash;Gas pipes should be run with
    a continuous fall towards the meter, and no low places. The gas
    meter should be set in a cool place, to keep it from
    registering against you; but if a "water meter," it should be
    protected from freezing. Cupboards, wardrobes, bookcases, etc.,
    generally afford receptacles for dust on their tops. This may
    be avoided by carrying them clear up to the ceiling. When this
    is not done, their tops should be sheeted over flush with the
    highest line of their cornices, so that there may be no sunken
    lodging-place for dust. Furring spaces between the furring and
    the outer walls should be stopped off at each floor line with
    brick and mortar "fire stops;" and the same with hollow
    interior partition walls. Soil pipes should never have <b>T</b>
    branches; always curves, or <b>Y</b> branches. Water pipes
    should be run in a continuous grade, and have a stop and waste
    cock at the lowest point, so as to be entirely emptied when
    desired. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page142"
       id="page142"></a>[pg 142]</span> Furnaces should have as few
       joints as possible, and the iron fire-pot is better lined
       with fire-brick. There should be no damper in the smoke
       pipe; but the ash-door should shut air-tight when desired.
       There should be provision for the evaporation of water in
       the hot-air pipe. "Air boxes" should never be of wood. All
       air boxes should be accessible from one end to the other, to
       clean them of dust, cobwebs, insects, etc. Horizontal
       hot-air flues should not be over 15 feet long. Parapets
       should be provided with impervious coping-stones to keep
       water from descending through the walls. Sewer pipes should
       not be so large as to be difficult to flush. The oval
       sections (point down) are the best. Soil-pipes should have a
       connection with the upper air, of the full diameter of the
       pipe to be ventilated. Stationary wash-tubs of wood are apt
       to get soaked up with organic matter and filth. Stationary
       washstands in bedrooms should have small traps; underneath
       each should be a leaden tray to protect ceilings in case of
       leakage, breakage or accidental overflow. This tray should
       have an overflow, and this overflow should be trapped, if
       connected with the foul-pipe system (which it should
       <i>not</i> be if possible to arrange it otherwise). Flues
       should have a smooth parging or lining, or they will be apt
       to draw with difficulty. Gas pipes of insufficient diameter
       cause the flames to burn with unsteady, dim light. Made
       ground is seldom fit for immediate building; and never for
       other than isolated structures. Ashes, street-sweepings,
       garbage, rotten vegetation, and house refuse are unfit
       filling for low ground on which it is intended to build.
       Cobble pavements are admirably adapted to soaking-up and
       afterwards emitting unwholesome matters. Asphalt has none of
       this fault. Wood is pernicious in this respect. "Gullies" in
       cellar floors should be properly trapped; and this does
       <i>not</i> mean that they shall have bell-traps nor
       siphon-traps with shallow water-seal. Cellar windows should
       be movable to let in air, and should have painted
       wire-screens to keep out cats, rats, etc. New walls are
       always damp. Window sills should project well out beyond the
       walls, and should be grooved underneath so as to throw the
       water clear of the walls. Cracks in floors, between the
       boards, help the accumulation of dirt and dust, and may
       harbor vermin. Narrow boards of course have narrower
       interstitial cracks than wide boards do. "Secret nailing" is
       best where it can be afforded. Hot-air flues should never be
       carried close to unprotected woodwork. Electric bells, when
       properly put up and cared for, are a great convenience in a
       house; but when they don't work, they are about as
       aggravating as the law allows. Cheap pushbuttons cause a
       great deal of annoyance. Silver-plated faucets and trimmings
       blacken with illuminating and sewer gases. Nickel-plating is
       perhaps a less pleasing white, but is cheaper and does not
       discolor readily. Windows are in most respects a great
       blessing; but there may be too much of a good thing. It is
       unreasonable to expect that one grate or stove or furnace
       can heat a whole county. Don't attempt it. If you have too
       many windows on the "cold side" of a house, give them double
       sashes (<i>not</i> double panes), and "weather-strip" them.
       Unpainted trimmings should be of hardwood. Yellow pine
       finishes up well. Butternut is brighter than walnut. Cherry
       makes a room cheerful. Walnut is dull and dismal.</p>

    <p>The Forests of the World.&mdash;The rapid exhaustion of the
    forests of the world, and more particularly of the once great
    reserves of timber in the United States and Canada, renders it
    inevitable that, in a very few years indeed, iron must
    supersede wood for a variety of uses. The drain upon the
    world's resources in timber is prodigious. Every year
    92,000,000 railway sleepers are used in America alone, while to
    supply firewood for the whole of the States, fourteen times the
    quantity of wood consumed by the railways is annually required.
    At the computation of the most recent statistics there were
    441,000,000 of acres of woodland in the United States; but
    since over 50,000,000 of acres are cut down yearly, this great
    area of timber will be non-existent in less than twenty years,
    unless replanting upon a very extensive scale be at once
    undertaken. Already efforts are being made in this direction,
    and not long since some 4,000,000 of saplings were planted in a
    single day in Kansas and the neighboring States. But since the
    daily consumption is even greater than this, it is obvious that
    the work of replanting must be undertaken systematically if it
    is to keep pace, even approximately, with the destruction. In
    France and Germany, where the forests are national property,
    forestry has been elevated to the status of an exact science;
    but the timber lands of those countries are small indeed
    compared with those in the United States.</p>

    <p>A Church Built from a Single Tree.&mdash;A redwood tree
    furnished all the timber for the Baptist church in Santa Rosa,
    one of the largest church edifices in the country. The interior
    of the building is finished in wood, there being no plastered
    walls. Sixty thousand shingles were made from the tree after
    enough was taken for the church. Another redwood tree, cut near
    Murphy's Mill, about ten years ago, furnished shingles that
    required the constant labor of two industrious men for two
    years before the tree was used up.</p>

    <p>Trees That Sink.&mdash;Of the more than four hundred species
    of trees found in the United States there are said to be
    sixteen species whose perfectly dry wood will sink in water.
    The heaviest of these is the black ironwood of southern
    Florida, which is more than thirty per cent. heavier than
    water. Of the others, the best known are the lignum vit&aelig;
    and mangrove; another is a small oak found in the mountains of
    western Texas, southern New Mexico, and Arizona, and westward
    to Colorado, at an elevation of 5,000 to 10,000 feet.</p>

    <p>Artificial Wood.&mdash;You can produce an artificial fire
    and waterproof wood in the following manner. More or less
    finely divided wood shavings, straw, tan, etc., singly or
    mixed, are moistened with a weak solution of zinc chloride of
    about 1.026 sp. gr., and allowed to dry. They are then treated
    with a basic solution of magnesium chloride of 1.725 to 1.793
    sp. gr., and pressed into moulds. The materials remain ten to
    twelve hours under pressure, during which time they harden
    while becoming heated. After being dried for several days in a
    warm, airy place, they are placed for ten or twelve hours into
    a strong solution of zinc chloride of about 1.205 sp. gr., and
    finally dried again. The product is stated to be workable like
    hardwood, and to be capable of taking a fine polish after being
    tooled. It is fireproof and inpermeable to water, and weak acid
    or alkaline solutions, and not affected by the humidity of the
    atmosphere, being well suited to decorative purposes, as it
    will not warp and fly like wood, but retain its form.</p>

    <p>How to Stain Wood.&mdash;The following are recipes for
    staining wood, which are used in large establishments with
    great success: Light Walnut&mdash;Dissolve 3 oz. permanganate
    of potash in six pints of water, and paint the wood twice with
    the solution. After the solution has been left on the wood for
    from five to ten minutes, the wood is rinsed, dried, oiled, and
    finally polished. Light Mahogany&mdash;1 oz. finely cut alkanet
    root, 2 ozs. powdered aloe, and 2 ozs. powdered dragon's blood
    are digested with 26 ozs. of strong spirits of wine in a corked
    bottle, and left in a moderately warm place for four days. The
    solution is then filtered off, and the clear filtrate is ready
    for use. The wood which is to be stained is first passed
    through nitric acid, then dried, painted over with the
    alcoholic extract, dried,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"
       id="page143"></a>[pg 143]</span> oiled and polished. Dark
       Walnut.&mdash;3 ozs. permanganate of potash are dissolved in
       six pints of water, and the wood is painted twice with this
       solution. After five minutes the wood is washed, and grained
       with acetate of iron (the ordinary iron liquor of the dyer)
       at 20&deg; Tw. Dry, oil and polish as usual. Gray&mdash;1
       oz. nitrate of silver is dissolved in 45 ozs. water, and the
       wood painted twice with the solution; afterwards the wood is
       submitted to the action of hydrochloric acid, and finally
       washed with ammonia. It is then dried in a dark place, oiled
       and polished. This is said to give remarkably good results
       on beech, pitch pine and poplar. Black&mdash;7 ozs. logwood
       are boiled with three pints of water, filtered, and the
       filtrate mixed with a solution containing 1 oz. of sulphate
       of copper (blue copperas). The mixture is left to clear, and
       the clear liquor decanted while still hot. The wood is
       placed in this liquor for twenty-four hours; it is then
       exposed to the air for twenty-four hours, and afterwards
       passed through a hot bath of nitrate of iron of 6&deg; Tw.
       If the black, after this treatment, should not be
       sufficiently developed, the wood has to be passed again
       through the first logwood bath.</p>

    <p>The Highest Chimney in the World.&mdash;The highest chimney
    in the world is said to be that recently completed at the lead
    mines in Mechernich. It is 134 meters (439 ft. 6 in.) high, was
    commenced in 1884, and was carried up 23 meters before the
    frost set in; building was again resumed on the 14th of last
    April, and it was completed last September. The foundation,
    which is of dressed stone, is square, measuring 11 meters (33
    ft.) on each side, and is 3.50 meters (11 ft. 6 in.) deep; the
    base is also square, and is carried up 10 meters (33 ft.) above
    the ground. The chimney-stack is of circular section, 7.50
    meters (24 ft. 6 in.) diameter at the bottom, and tapering to
    3.50 meters diameter (11 ft. 6 in.) at the top, and is 120.50
    meters (395 ft.) high.</p>

    <p>How to Measure Round Tanks.&mdash;Square the diameter of the
    tank, and multiply by.7854, which gives the area; then multiply
    area by depth of tank, and the cubic contents will be found.
    Allow 6-1/4 gallons for each cubic foot.</p>

    <p>The Largest Buildings in the World.&mdash;Where is the
    largest building in the world situated? The answer to this
    question must depend upon what the term "building" is held to
    represent. The Great Wall of China, 1,280 miles in length, wide
    enough to allow six horsemen to ride abreast along it, and with
    an average height of 20 ft., may fairly be called a building;
    so, too, may be called the Great Pyramid of Egypt. The
    question, however, was not meant to include such works as
    these. Some have supposed that the Vatican at Rome, with its
    eight grand staircases, 200 smaller staircases, 20 courts, and
    11,000 apartments, is the largest building in the world; but
    surely this is a collection of palaces rather than a single
    building. The same objection applies to the famous monastery of
    the Escurial in the province of Madrid, with its seven towers,
    fifteen gateways, and 12,000 windows and doors, and to many
    other vast piles. For the largest single building extant, we
    must look to St. Peter's at Rome, within which our great
    cathedral, St. Paul's, could easily stand. St. Peter's occupies
    a space of 240,000 sq. ft., its front is 400 ft. broad, rising
    to a height of 180 ft.; the length of the interior is 600 ft.,
    its breadth 442 ft. It is capable of holding 54,000 people,
    while its piazza, in its widest limits, holds 624,000. It is
    only by degrees that one is able to realize its vast size. St.
    Peter's holds 54,000 persons; Milan Cathedral, 37,000; St.
    Paul's, Rome, 32,000; St. Paul's, London, 25,600; St. Petronio,
    Bologna, 24,400; Florence Cathedral, 24,300; Antwerp Cathedral,
    24,000; St. Sophia, Constantinople, 23,000; Notre Dame, Paris,
    21,000; Pisa Cathedral, 13,000; St. Stephen's, Vienna, 12,400;
    Auditorium, Chicago, 12,000; St. Mark's, Venice, 7,000.</p>

    <p>The Biggest Bell in the World.&mdash;There is a bell in the
    Temple of Clars, at Kinto, Japan, which is larger than the
    great bell of Moscow, or any other. It is covered with Chinese
    and Sanskrit characters which Japanese scholars have not yet
    succeeded in translating. There is no record of its casting.
    Its height is 24 ft., and at the rim it has a thickness of 16
    in. It has no clapper, but is struck on the outside by a kind
    of wooden battering-ram. We are unable to obtain any more exact
    particulars as to the dimensions of this bell in order to
    determine whether or no it really does excel the "Monarch" of
    Moscow, which weighs about 193 tons, is 19 ft. 3 in. in height,
    60 ft. 9 in. in circumference, and 2 ft. thick. There is
    another huge bell at Moscow, and those at Amazapoora, in
    Burmah, and at Pekin are far bigger than any we have in this
    country. Our biggest bell is "Great Paul," which was cast at
    Loughborough in 1881, and which weighs 17-1/2 tons. Taking
    purity, volume, and correctness of note into account, it is
    probably the finest bell in Europe.</p>

    <p>The Oldest Cities in the World.&mdash;They are the
    following:&mdash;Argos, Athens and Thebes, in Greece; Crotona
    and Rome, in Italy; Cadiz and Saguntum, in Spain;
    Constantinople, in Turkey, and Marseilles, in France, which was
    founded by a colony of Greeks 580 B.C. The age of these cities
    varies from twenty-four to twenty-seven centuries.</p>

    <p>How to Manufacture Oil of Apple, or Essence of
    Apple.&mdash;The essence of apple is composed of aldehyde 2
    parts; chloroform, acetic ether and nitrous ether and oxalic
    acid each 1 part; glycerin 4 parts; <ins class="correction"
    title="Transcribers's Note: The original text reads 'amyl valerianice ther10 parts'.">
    amyl valerianic ether 10 parts</ins>.</p>

    <p>A Formula for the Manufacture of Artificial
    Cider.&mdash;Imitation cider consists of 25 gallons soft water,
    25 pounds New Orleans sugar; 1 pint yeast; two pounds tartaric
    acid. Put all the ingredients into a clean cask, and stir them
    up well after standing twenty-four hours with the bung out.
    Then bung the cask up tight, add 3 gallons spirits, and let it
    stand forty-eight hours, after which time it will be ready for
    use. Champagne cider can be prepared by taking 10 gallons of
    cider, old and clear. Put this in a strong, iron-bound cask
    pitched inside (like beer casks); add 2-1/2 pints clarified
    white plain syrup; then dissolve in it 5 ounces tartaric acid;
    keep the bung ready in hand, then add 7-1/2 ounces of potassium
    bicarbonate; bung it as quickly and as well as possible.</p>

    Extractor.&mdash;Take of chloride of lime 1 pound, thoroughly
    pulverized, and 4 quarts soft water. The foregoing must be
    thoroughly shaken when first put together. It is required to
    stand twenty-four hours to dissolve the chloride of lime; then
    strain through a cotton cloth, after which add a teaspoonful of
    acetic acid to every ounce of the chloride of lime water.</p>

    <p>Wood, which is a more unyielding material, acts with
    tremendous force when wetted, and advantage has been taken of
    this fact in splitting blocks of granite. This process is
    largely adopted in Dartmoor. After a mass of granite has been
    rent from the mountain by blasting, it is measured in every
    direction to see how best to divide it into smaller blocks.
    These are traced out by straight lines on the surface, and a
    series of holes are drilled at short intervals along this line.
    Wedges of dry wood are then tightly driven into the holes and
    wetted, and the combined action of the swelling wood splits the
    block in the direction required, and without any destructive
    violence. The same process is then carried out upon the other
    faces, and the roughly-shapen block finished with the hammer
    and chisel.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"

    <p>The Weight and Value of a Cubic Foot of Solid Gold or
    Silver.&mdash;A cubic foot of gold weighs about 19,300 ounces,
    and gold is worth $20.67 per ounce. Silver is worth $1.29 per
    ounce, and a cubic foot weighs 10,500 ounces. Consequently the
    cubic foot of gold would be worth $398,931, and the silver
    $13,545.</p>

    <p>To Remove Spots on Brass.&mdash;Sulphuric acid will remove
    spots from brass that will not yield to oxalic acid. It may be
    applied with a brush, but great care must be taken that no drop
    of the acid shall come in contact with the clothes or skin, as
    it is ruinous to garments and cuticle. Bath brick or
    rottenstone may be used for polishing.</p>

    <p>A Formula to Make a Good Shoe Dressing.&mdash;Gum shellac,
    1/2 pound; alcohol, 3 quarts; dissolve, and add camphor, 1-1/2
    ounces; lampblack, 2 ounces. The foregoing will be found to
    give an excellent gloss, and is especially adapted to any
    leather, the surface of which is roughened by wear.</p>

    <p>Receipts for Dyeing Cotton Fabric Red, Blue and
    Ecru.&mdash;Red: Muriate of tin, two-thirds cupful, add water
    to cover goods; raise to boiling heat; put in goods one hour;
    stir often; take out, empty kettle, put in clean water with
    Nicaragua wood one pound; steep one-half hour at hand heat,
    then put in goods and increase heat one hour, not boiling. Air
    goods, and dip one hour as before. Wash without soap. Blue: For
    three pounds goods, blue vitriol 4 ounces; boil few minutes,
    then dip goods three hours; then pass them through strong lime
    water. Ecru: Continue the foregoing operation for blue by
    passing the goods through a solution of prussiate of
    potash.</p>

    <p>MOTION OF WAVES.&mdash;The progressive motion of a wave on
    the water exactly corresponds in speed with that of a pendulum
    whose length is equal to the breadth of the wave; the same law,
    gravity, governs both.</p>

    <p>LIGHT OF THE SUN.&mdash;A photometric experiment of Huygens,
    resumed by Wollaston, a short time before his death, teaches us
    that 20,000 stars the same size as Sirius, the most brilliant
    in the firmament, would need to be agglomerated to shed upon
    our globe a light equal to that of the sun.</p>

    <p>Land Cultivation in Japan.&mdash;The entire arable land of
    the Japanese empire is officially put at only 11,215,000 acres;
    but it is so fertile and thoroughly cultivated that it feeds a
    population of 37,000,000, about that of France. Rice is one of
    the principal crops, and of this some 200,000,000 bushels are
    raised annually.</p>

    <p>Old London Bridge.&mdash;As early as the year 978 there was
    a wooden bridge where London bridge now stands. This was
    replaced by another in 1014, and another in 1209. The present
    London bridge was erected in 1831, and may be considered the
    oldest existing bridge over the river.</p>

    <p>The Shortest Method of Removing Silver from Plated Ware
    Before Replating.&mdash;Dip the article in nitric acid; this
    will remove the silver.</p>

    <p>A Formula for White Metal.&mdash;Copper, 69.8 parts; nickel,
    19.8 parts; zinc, 5.5 parts; cadmium, 4.7 parts. It takes a
    fine polish.</p>

    <p>Curiosities of Metal Working.&mdash;At a recent meeting of
    scientific men, a speaker produced an anklet worn by East
    Indian women. This is a flat curb chain about one inch broad,
    with the links very close, and weighing about ten or twelve
    ounces. It is composed of a species of brass composed of copper
    and lead, without any trace of silver, zinc, or tin. Such
    anklets are sold for a few pence, and they are cast all at
    once, complete as an endless chain. The links show no sign of
    having been united in any way. How it was possible to produce
    such a casting as this passed his comprehension, and he hoped
    that some one who had seen them made would explain the nature
    of the process. From the East much that was curious in
    metallurgical art came. Cast-iron was, he believed, first made
    purposely in China. It was, however, frequently produced
    unintentionally, when wrought-iron was made direct from the ore
    in little furnaces about as big as a chimney-pot. It was found
    among the cinders and ash of the <ins class="correction"
         title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'coarcoal-fire'.">
    charcoal-fire</ins> in grains or globules, which were not only
    like shot, but were actually used as shot by the natives. He
    showed what he believed was the only specimen in England of
    this cast-iron, in a bottle. He next referred to the celebrated
    Damascene blades of Indian swords, and explained that these
    blades were an intimate mixture of wrought-iron and hard steel,
    which must have required great skill, time and patience for its
    production. One <ins class="correction"
     title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'patern'.">pattern</ins>,
     in particular, known as "Mary's Ladder," showed wonderful
     finish and accuracy. Concerning the tempering of these
     blades little was known; but it was stated that it was
     affected by a long-continued hammering, or rather tapping,
     of the blade while cold.</p>

    <p>How Many Tons of Coal a Large Steamship Consumes in a
    Day.&mdash;"Ocean steamers are large consumers of coal. The
    Orient line, with their fleet of ships running to Australia
    every two weeks, may be mentioned. The steamship Austral went
    from London to Sydney in thirty-five days, and consumed on the
    voyage 3,641 tons of coal; Her coal bunkers hold 2,750 tons.
    The steamship Oregon consumes over 330 tons per day on her
    passage from Liverpool to New York; her bunkers will hold
    nearly 4,000 tons. The Stirling Castle last year brought home
    in one cargo 2,200 tons of tea, and consumed 2,800 tons of coal
    in doing so. Immense stocks of coal are kept at various coaling
    stations. St. Vincent, Madeira, Port Said, Singapore and
    others; the reserve at the latter place is about 20,000 tons.
    It is remarkable with what rapidity these steamers are coaled;
    for instance, the Orient steamship last year took in over 1,100
    tons at Port Said in five hours."</p>

    <p>What a Man Eats.&mdash;A French statistician has just
    ascertained that a human being of either sex who is a moderate
    eater and who lives to be 70 years old consumes during his life
    a quantity of food which would fill twenty ordinary railway
    baggage cars. A "good eater," however, may require as many as
    thirty.</p>

    <p>An Australian Railway Viaduct.&mdash;The Werribee Viaduct,
    in the colony of Victoria, is the longest work of the kind in
    Australia. The structure consists of lattice-girder work. It is
    1,290 feet in length, and runs to a height of 125 feet above
    the level of the Werribee river. The viaduct has fifteen spans
    each of 60 feet, and thirteen spans of 30 feet. The total cost
    of the bridge was &pound;600,000.</p>

    <p>The Sharpening of Tools.&mdash;Instead of oil, which
    thickens and smears the stone, a mixture of glycerine and
    spirit is recommended. The proportions of the composition vary
    according to the class of tool to be sharpened. One with a
    relatively large surface is best sharpened with a clear fluid,
    three parts of glycerine being mixed with one part of spirit. A
    graver having a small cutting surface only requires a small
    pressure on the stone, and in such cases the glycerine should
    be mixed with only two or three drops of spirit.</p>

    <p>Recipes for Plumbers.&mdash;Chloride of zinc, so much used
    in soldering iron, has, besides its corrosive qualities, the
    drawback of being unwholesome when used for soldering
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page145"
       id="page145"></a>[pg 145]</span> the iron tins employed to
       can fruit, vegetables and other foods. A soldering mixture
       has been found which is free from these defects. It is made
       by mixing one pound of lactic acid with one pound of
       glycerine and eight pounds of water. A wooden tank may be
       rendered capable of withstanding the effects of nitric or
       sulphuric acids by the following methods:&mdash;Cover the
       inside with paraffin; go over the inside with a sadiron
       heated to the temperature used in ironing clothes. Melt the
       paraffin under the iron so as to drive it into the wood as
       much as possible, then with a cooler iron melt on a coat
       thick enough to completely cover the wood. For brassing
       small articles: To one quart water add half an ounce each of
       sulphate copper and protochloride of tin. Stir the articles
       in the solution until the desired color is obtained. Use the
       sulphate of copper alone for a copper color. A good cement
       for celluloid is made from one part shellac dissolved in one
       part of spirit of camphor and three to four parts of ninety
       per cent. alcohol. The cement should be applied warm, and
       the broken parts securely held together until the solvent
       has entirely evaporated. Tin and tin alloys, after careful
       cleansing from oxide and grease, are handsomely and
       permanently bronzed if brushed over with a solution of one
       part of sulphate of copper (bluestone) and one part of
       sulphate of iron (copperas) in twenty parts of water. When
       this has dried, the surface should be brushed with a
       solution of one part of acetate of copper (verdigris) in
       acetic acid. After several applications and dryings of the
       last named, the surface is polished with a soft brush and
       bloodstone powder. The raised portions are then rubbed off
       with soft leather moistened with wax in turpentine, followed
       by a rubbing with dry leather.</p>

    <p>Protecting Water-Pipes Against Frost.&mdash;A device has
    been brought forward for protecting water-pipes against
    freezing, the arrangement being based upon the fact that water
    in motion will remain liquid at a lower temperature than water
    at rest. One end of a copper rod, placed outside the building,
    is secured to a bracket, and the other end is attached to one
    arm of a weighted elbow lever; to the other arm of the lever is
    secured a rod which passes into the building and operates a
    valve in the water-pipe. By means of turn buckles the length of
    the copper rod can be adjusted so that before the temperature
    reaches the point at which there would be danger of the water
    in the pipes freezing the valve will be opened to allow a flow
    of water; beyond this point the valve opening will increase and
    the flow become more rapid as the cold becomes more intense,
    and as the temperature rises the valve is closed. This plan
    sets up a current in the pipes, which replaces the water as it
    grows cold by the warmer water from the main.</p>

    <p>Destructive Work of Barnacles.&mdash;Unless some paint can
    be found which is proof against barnacles, it may be necessary
    to sheath steel vessels with an alloy of copper. An attempt has
    been made to cover the hulls with anti-corrosive paint and
    cover this with an outside coat which should resist the attack
    of barnacles. Somehow the barnacles eat their way through the
    paint and attach themselves to the hull. The vast item of
    expense attached to the dry-docking of steel ships makes this
    matter a not unimportant one. The barnacles interfere greatly
    with the speed of a vessel, and in a cruiser speed is of prime
    importance. They attach themselves in an incredibly short time
    to a steel hull, and it is not long before their effect can be
    noted by a comparison of the reading of the log.</p>

    <p>How to Frost Glass.&mdash;Two ounces of spirits of salts,
    two ounces of oil of vitriol, one ounce of sulphate of copper,
    one ounce of gum arabic, mixed together and dabbed on with a
    brush; or this:&mdash;Dab your squares regularly over with
    putty; when dry go over them again&mdash;the imitation will be
    executed. Or this:&mdash;Mix Epsom salts with porter and apply
    it with a brush. Or this one:&mdash;Grind and mix white lead in
    three-fourths of boiled oil, and one-fourth of spirits of
    turpentine, and, to give the mixture a very drying quality, add
    sufficient quantities of burnt white vitriol and sugar of lead.
    The color must be made exceedingly thin, and put on the panes
    of glass with a large painting-brush in as even a manner as
    possible. When a number of the panes are thus painted take a
    dry duster, quite new, dab the ends of the bristles on the
    glass in quick succession till you give it a uniform
    appearance; repeat this operation till the work appears very
    soft, and it will then appear like ground glass. When the
    windows require fresh painting, get the old coat off first by
    using strong pearlash water.</p>

    <p>How to Preserve Posts.&mdash;Wood can be made to last longer
    than iron in the ground, if prepared according to the following
    recipe:&mdash;Take boiled linseed oil and stir in pulverized
    coal to the consistency of paint. Put a coat of this over the
    timber, and there is not a man that will live to see it
    rot.</p>

    <p>What Diamond Dyes and Paints Are Made of.&mdash;Solutions of
    the aniline colors.</p>

    <p>What the Ingredients Are of Soapine and Pearline.&mdash;They
    consist of partly effloresced sal soda mixed with half its
    weight of soda ash. Some makers add a little yellow soap,
    coarsely powdered, to disguise the appearance, and others a
    little carbonate of ammonium or borax.</p>

    <h3>SUSTAINING POWER OF ICE.</h3>

    <p>The sustaining power of ice at various degrees of thickness
    is given in the following paragraphs:</p>

    <p>At a thickness of two inches, will support a man.</p>

    <p>At a thickness of four inches, will support man on
    horseback.</p>

    <p>At a thickness of six inches, will support teams with
    moderate loads.</p>

    <p>At a thickness of eight inches, will support heavy
    loads.</p>

    <p>At a thickness of ten inches, will support 1,000 pounds to
    the square foot.</p>

    <h3>THE EXPANSIVE POWER OF WATER.</h3>

    <p>It is a well known, but not less remarkable fact, that if
    the tip of an exceedingly small tube be dipped into water, the
    water will rise spontaneously in the tube throughout its whole
    length. This may be shown in a variety of ways; for instance,
    when a piece of sponge, or sugar, or cotton is just allowed to
    touch water, these substances being all composed of numberless
    little tubes, draw up the water, and the whole of the piece
    becomes wet. It is said to <i>suck up</i> or <i>imbibe</i> the
    moisture. We see the same wonderful action going on in nature
    in the rising of the sap through the small tubes or pores of
    the wood, whereby the leaves and upper portions of the plant
    derive nourishment from the ground.</p>

    <p>This strange action is called "capillary," from the
    resemblance the minute tubes bear to a hair, the Latin of which
    is <i>capillus</i>. It is, moreover, singular that the
    absorption of the water takes place with great force. If a dry
    sponge be enclosed tightly in a vessel, it will expand when
    wetted, with sufficient force to burst it, unless very
    strong.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page146"

    <p>London Water Supply.&mdash;The quantity of water consumed in
    London amounts to about 145,000,000 gallons a day. If this
    quantity could be collected together, it would form a lake 700
    yards long, 200 wide, and with a uniform depth of 20 feet.</p>

    <p>A Protection for Embankments.&mdash;Engineers often have
    considerable trouble with the loose soil of newly-made
    embankments, so apt to slip or be washed away before they are
    covered with vegetation. According to a French railway
    engineer, the best plan is to sow the banks with the double
    poppy. Several months elapse before grasses and clovers develop
    their feeble roots, but the double poppy germinates in a few
    days, and in a fortnight has grown sufficiently to afford some
    protection to the slope, while at the end of three or four
    months the roots, which are ten or twelve inches in length, are
    found to have interlaced so as to retain the earth far more
    firmly than those of any grass or grain. Although the double
    poppy is an annual, it sows itself after the first year.</p>

    <p>A Cheap Concrete.&mdash;A kind of concrete made without
    cement is composed of 8 parts of sand, gravel and pebbles, 1
    part of burnt and powdered common earth, 1 part of pulverized
    clinkers and cinders, and 1-1/2 parts of unslacked hydraulic
    lime. These materials are thoroughly incorporated while dry
    into a homogeneous mixture, which is then wetted up and well
    beaten. The result of this is a hard and solid mass, which sets
    almost immediately, becoming exceedingly strong after a few
    days. It may be made still stronger by the addition of a small
    proportion&mdash;say 1 part&mdash;of cement.</p>

    <p>Marking Tools.&mdash;To mark tools, first coyer the article
    to be marked with a thin coating of tallow or beeswax, and with
    a sharp instrument write the name in the tallow. Clear with a
    feather, fill the letters with nitric acid, let it remain from
    one to ten minutes, then dip in water and run off, and the
    marks will be etched into the steel or iron.</p>

    <p>How to Prevent Chisel Handles Splitting.&mdash;All
    carpenters know how soon the butt-end of chisel handles split
    when daily exposed to the blow of a mallet or hammer. A remedy
    suggested by a Brooklyn man consists simply of sawing or
    cutting off the round end of the handle so as to make it flat,
    and attaching by a few nails on the top of it two discs of sole
    leather, so that the end becomes similar to the heel of the
    boot. The two thicknesses of leather will prevent all further
    splitting, and if, in the course of time, they expand and
    overlap the wood of the handle, they are simply trimmed off all
    around.</p>

    <p>The Largest Wheel of Its Kind Ever Made in the
    World.&mdash;The greatest wheel of its kind in the world, a
    very wonder in mechanism, was built for the Calumet and Hecla
    Mining Company of Lake Superior, Mich., for the purpose of
    lifting and discharging the "tailings," a waste from the copper
    mines, into the lake. Its diameter is 54 feet; weight in active
    operation, 200 tons. Its extreme dimensions are 54 feet in
    diameter. Some idea of its enormous capacity can be formed from
    the fact that it receives and elevates sufficient sand every
    twenty-four hours to cover an acre of ground a foot deep. It is
    armed on its outer edge with 432 teeth, 4.71 inches pitch and
    18 inches face. The gear segments, eighteen in number, are made
    of gun iron, and the teeth are machine-cut, epicycloidal in
    form. It took two of the most perfect machines in the world 100
    days and nights to cut the teeth alone, and the finish is as
    smooth as glass. The wheel is driven by a pinion of gun iron
    containing 33 teeth of equal pitch and face and runs at a speed
    of 600 feet per minute at the inner edge, where it is equipped
    with 448 steel buckets that lift the "tailings" as the machine
    revolves and discharges them into launders that carry them into
    the lake. The shaft of the wheel is of gun iron, and its
    journals are 22 inches in diameter by 3 feet 4 inches long. The
    shaft is made in three sections and is 30 inches in diameter in
    the center. At a first glance the great wheel looks like an
    exaggerated bicycle wheel, and it is constructed much on the
    same principle, with straining rods that run to centers cast on
    the outer sections of the shaft. The steel buckets on either
    side of the gear are each 4 feet 5-1/2 inches long and 21
    inches deep, and the combined lifting capacity of the 448,
    running at a speed of 600 feet per minute, will be 3,000,000
    gallons of water and 2,000 tons of sand every twenty-four
    hours. The mammoth wheel is supported on two massive adjustable
    pedestals of cast iron weighing twelve tons each, and its cost
    at the copper mines before making a single revolution,
    $100,000.</p>

    <p>Strength of Brick Walls.&mdash;The question of strength of
    brick walls is often discussed, and differences of opinion
    expressed. The following is one of the rules given:&mdash;For
    first-class buildings, with good workmanship, the general
    average should not exceed a greater number of feet in height
    than three times its thickness of wall in inches, and the
    length not to exceed double the height, without lateral
    supports of walls, buttresses, etc., as follows for safety:</p>

    <p>Where the lengths must exceed these proportions, as in

    <p>Qualities of Building Stone.&mdash;The principal qualities
    of a good building stone are&mdash;(1) Strength, (2) hardness,
    (3) durability, (4) appearance, (5) facility for working. There
    are also other minor points; but stone possessing one or more
    of the above qualities, according to the purpose for which it
    is required, may be regarded as good for that purpose.</p>

    <p>Strength of Stone.&mdash;Stone should only be subjected to a
    compressive strain. It is occasionally subject to a cross
    strain, as in lintels over doors and windows; these are,
    however, contrary to the true principles of construction, and
    should not be allowed except a strong relieving arch is turned
    over them. The strength of stone in compression is about 120
    tons per square foot for the weakest stones, and about 750 tons
    per square foot for the strongest. No stones are, however,
    subjected to anything like this amount of compressive force; in
    the largest buildings it does not amount to more than twelve or
    fourteen tons per square foot.</p>

    <p>Hardness of Stone.&mdash;This is of more importance than its
    strength, especially in pavements or steps, where it is subject
    to great wear; also in plinths and quoins of buildings where it
    is desired to preserve a good face and sharp arris. The order
    of strength and hardness of stone is&mdash;(1) Basalt, (2)
    granite, (3) limestone, (4) sandstone. Granite, seinite, and
    gneiss take the first, place for strength, hardness and
    durability, but they will not stand a high temperature. "Stones
    which are of a fine, uniform grain, compact texture and deep
    color are the strongest; and when the grain, color, and texture
    are the same, those are the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"
       id="page147"></a>[pg 147]</span> strongest which are the
       heaviest; but otherwise the strength does not increase with
       the specific gravity." Great hardness is objectionable when
       the stone has to be worked with a chisel, owing to the labor
       required to work it. Hard stones, also, generally wear
       smooth, and become polished, which makes them unsuitable for
       some purposes. Brittleness is a defect which frequently
       accompanies hardness, particularly in coarse-grained stones;
       it prevents them from being worked to a true surface, and
       from receiving a smooth edge at the angles. Workmen call
       those hard stones which can only be sawn into slabs by the
       grit saw, and those soft which can be separated by a common
       saw.</p>

    <p>Expansion of Stone by Heat.&mdash;Rocks are expanded by heat
    and contracted by cooling. Variation in temperature thus causes
    some building stones to alternately expand and contract, and
    this prevents the joints of masonry from remaining close and
    tight. In the United States with an annual thermometric range
    of more than 90 deg. Fah., this difficulty led to some
    experiments on the amount of expansion and contraction in
    different kinds of building stones. It was found that in
    fine-grained granite the rate of expansion was .000004825 for
    every degree Fah., of increment of heat; in white crystalline
    marble it was .000005668; and in red sandstone .000009532, or
    about twice as much as in granite. In Western America, where
    the climate is remarkably dry and clear, the thermometer often
    gives a range of more than 80 deg. in twenty-four hours. This
    great difference of temperature produces a strain so great that
    it causes rocks to crack or peel off in skins or irregular
    pieces, or in some cases, it disintegrates them into sand. Dr.
    Livingstone found in Africa (12 deg. S. lat., 34 deg. E. long.)
    that surfaces of rock which during the day were heated up to
    137 deg. Fah. cooled so rapidly by radiation at night that
    unable to stand the strain of contraction, they split and threw
    off sharp angular fragments from a few ounces to 100 lbs. or
    200 lbs. in weight. According to data obtained from Adie
    "Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin.," xiii., p. 366, and Totten the
    expansion of ordinary rocks ranges from about 2.47 to 9.63
    millionths for 1 deg. Fah.</p>

    <h3>BLUNDERS AND ABSURDITIES IN ART.</h3>

    <p>In looking over some collections of old pictures, it is
    surprising what extraordinary <ins class="correction"
    title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'anachornisms'.">
    anachronisms</ins>, blunders, and absurdities are often
    discoverable.</p>

    <p>In the gallery of the convent of Jesuits at Lisbon, there is
    a picture representing Adam in paradise, dressed in blue
    breeches with silver buckles, and Eve with a striped petticoat.
    In the distance appears a procession of Capuchin monks bearing
    the cross.</p>

    <p>In a country church in Holland there is a painting
    representing the sacrifice of Isaac, in which the painter has
    depicted Abraham with a blunderbus in his hand, ready to shoot
    his son. A similar edifice in Spain has a picture of the same
    incident, in which the patriarch is armed with a pistol.</p>

    <p>At Windsor there is a painting by Antonio Verrio, in which
    the artist has introduced the portraits of himself, Sir Godfrey
    Kneller, and May, the surveyor of the works of that period, all
    in long periwigs, as spectators of Christ healing the sick.</p>

    <p>A painter of Toledo, having to represent the three wise men
    of the East coming to worship on the nativity of Christ,
    depicted three Arabian or Indian kings, two of them white and
    one black, and all of them in the posture of kneeling. The
    position of the legs of each figure not being very distinct, he
    inadvertently painted three black feet for the negro king, and
    three also between the two white kings; and he did not discover
    his error until the picture was hung up in the cathedral.</p>

    <p>In another picture of the Adoration of the Magi, which was
    in the Houghton Hall collection, the painter, Brughel, had
    introduced a multitude of little figures, finished off with
    true Dutch exactitude, but one was accoutred in boots and
    spurs, and another was handing in, as a present, a little model
    of a Dutch ship.</p>

    <p>The same collection contained a painting of the stoning of
    Stephen, the martyr, by Le Soeur, in which the saint was
    attired in the habit of a Roman Catholic priest at high
    mass.</p>

    <p>A picture by Rubens, in the Luxembourg, represents the
    Virgin Mary in council, with two cardinals and the god Mercury
    assisting in her deliberations.</p>

    <h3>A STOPPAGE OF THE FALLS OF NIAGARA.</h3>

    <p>The following remarkable account of the stoppage of Niagara
    Falls, appeared in the <i>Niagara Mail</i> at the time of the
    occurrence: "That mysterious personage, the oldest inhabitant,
    has no recollection of so singular an occurrence as took place
    at the Falls on the 30th of March, 1847. The 'six hundred and
    twenty thousand tons of water each minute' nearly ceased to
    flow, and dwindled away into the appearance of a mere milldam.
    The rapids above the falls disappeared, leaving scarcely enough
    on the American side to turn a grindstone. Ladies and gentlemen
    rode in carriages one-third of the way across the river towards
    the Canada shore, over solid rock as smooth as a kitchen floor.
    The <i>Iris</i> says: 'Table Rock, with some two hundred yards
    more, was left dry; islands and places where the foot of man
    never dared to tread have been visited, flags placed upon come,
    and mementoes brought away. This unexpected event is attempted
    to be accounted for by an accumulation of ice at the lower
    extremity of Fort Erie, which formed a sort of dam between Fort
    Erie and Buffalo.'"</p>

    <h3>WONDERS OF MINUTE WORKMANSHIP.</h3>

    <p>In the twentieth year of Queen Elizabeth, a blacksmith named
    Mark Scaliot, made a lock consisting of eleven pieces of iron,
    steel and brass, all which, together with a key to it, weighed
    but one grain of gold. He also made a chain of gold, consisting
    of forty-three links, and, having fastened this to the
    before-mentioned lock and key, he put the chain about the neck
    of a flea, which drew them all with ease. All these together,
    lock and key, chain and flea, weighed only one grain and a
    half.</p>

    <p>Oswaldus Norhingerus, who was more famous even than Scaliot
    for his minute contrivances, is said to have made 1,600 dishes
    of turned ivory, all perfect and complete in every part, yet so
    small, thin and slender, that all of them were included at once
    in a cup turned out of a pepper-corn of the common size.
    Johannes Shad, of Mitelbrach, carried this wonderful work with
    him to Rome, and showed it to Pope Paul V., who saw and counted
    them all by the help of a pair of spectacles. They were so
    little as to be almost invisible to the eye.</p>

    <p>Johannes Ferrarius, a Jesuit, had in his posession cannons
    of wood, with their carriages, wheels, and all other military
    furniture, all of which were also contained in a pepper-corn of
    the ordinary size.</p>

    <p>An artist, named Claudius Callus, made for Hippolytus
    d'Este, Cardinal of Ferrara, representations of sundry birds
    setting on the tops of trees, which, by hydraulic art and
    secret conveyance of water through the trunks and branches of
    the trees, were made to sing and clap their wings; but, at the
    sudden appearance of an owl out of a bush of the same artifice,
    they immediately became all mute and
    silent.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"

    <h3>REMARKABLE INSCRIPTION.</h3>

    <p>The following singular inscription is to be seen carved on a
    tomb situated at the entrance of the church of San Salvador, in
    the city of Oviedo. The explanation is that the tomb was
    erected by a king named Silo, and the inscription is so written
    that it can be read 270 ways by beginning with the large S in
    the center. The words are Latin, "Silo princeps fecit."</p>

    <p>Besides this singular inscription, the letters H. S. E. S.
    S. T. T. L. are also carved on the tomb, but of these no
    explanation is given. Silo, Prince of Oviedo, or King of the
    Asturias, succeeded Aurelius in 774, and died in 785. He was,
    therefore, a contemporary of Charlemagne. No doubt the above
    inscription was the composition of some ingenious and learned
    Spanish monk.</p>

    <h3>CURIOUS CALCULATIONS.</h3>

    <h4>CONSUMPTION OF AIR IN ACTIVITY AND REPOSE.</h4>

    <p>Dr. Radclyffe Hall makes the following interesting statement
    with regard to the amount of air we consume in repose, and at
    different degrees of activity: When still, we use 500 cubic
    inches of air in a minute; if we walk at the rate of one mile
    an hour, we use 800; two miles, 1,000; three miles an hour,
    1,600; four miles an hour, 2,300. If we run at six miles an
    hour, we use 3,000 cubic inches; trotting a horse, 1,750;
    cantering, 1,500.</p>

    <h4>THE VALUE OF LABOR.</h4>

    <p>Cast iron of the value of &pound;1 sterling is worth,
    converted into ordinary machinery, &pound;4; in larger
    ornamented work, &pound;45; in buckles and similar kinds of
    fancy work, &pound;600; in neck chains, &pound;1,300. Bar iron
    of the value of &pound;1 sterling is worth, in the form of
    knives, &pound;36; needles, &pound;70; penknife blades,
    &pound;950; polished <ins class="correction"
    title="Transcriber's Note: The original text reads 'bottons'.">
    buttons</ins> and buckles, &pound;890; balance
    springs of watches, &pound;5,000.</p>

    <h4>INTEREST OF MONEY.</h4>

    <p>Dr. Price, in the second edition of his "Observations on
    Reversionary Payments," says: "It is well known to what
    prodigious sums money improved for some time at compound
    interest will increase. A penny so improved from our Saviour's
    birth, as to double itself every fourteen years&mdash;or, what
    is nearly the same, put out at five per cent. compound interest
    at our Saviour's birth&mdash;would by this time have increased
    to more money than could be contained in 150 millions of
    globes, each equal to the earth in magnitude, and all solid
    gold. A shilling, put out at six per cent. compound interest
    would, in the same time, have increased to a greater sum in
    gold than the whole solar system could hold, supposing it a
    sphere equal in diameter to the diameter of Saturn's orbit. And
    the earth is to such a sphere as half a square foot, or a
    quarto page, to the whole surface of the earth."</p>

    <h3>WONDERS OF SCIENCE.</h3>

    <p>A grain of gold has been found by Muncke to admit of being
    divided into <i>ninety-fire thousand millions of visible
    parts</i>; that is, by the aid of a microscope magnifying one
    thousand times. A sovereign is thus capable of division into
    ten millions of millions of visible particles, being ten
    thousand times as many such particles as there are men, women
    and children in all the world.</p>

    <p><b>SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION</b>.&mdash;Liebig, in his
    "Familiar Letters on Chemistry," has proved the unsoundness of
    spontaneous combustion. Yet Dr. Lindley gives nineteen
    instances of something akin, or the rapid ignition of the human
    body by contact with flame as a consequence of the saturation
    of its tissues by alcohol.</p>

    <p><b>VIBRATIONS OF THE AIR</b>.&mdash;If a person stand
    beneath a railway girder-bridge with an open umbrella over his
    head, when a train is passing, the vibration of the air will be
    distinctly felt in the hand which grasps the umbrella, because
    the outspread surface collects and concentrates the waves into
    the focus of the handle.</p>

    <p><b>THE EARTH'S CENTER</b>.&mdash;All bodies weigh less the
    further removed they are from the center of the earth. A block
    of stone weighing 700 pounds upon the sea-shore, will weigh
    only 699 pounds if carried up a mountain three miles high. A
    pendulum oscillates more quickly at the poles than at the
    equator, because the earth is flatter by twenty-six miles at
    the poles&mdash;that is, the "bob" of the pendulum is that much
    nearer the earth's center, and therefore heavier, and so swings
    more quickly.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
